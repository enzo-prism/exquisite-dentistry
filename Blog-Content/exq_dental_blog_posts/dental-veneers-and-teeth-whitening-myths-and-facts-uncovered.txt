# Dental Veneers and Teeth Whitening: Myths and Facts Uncovered

## Veneers and Teeth Whitening: Expectations vs. Reality

It’s no secret that dental veneers are a great way to transform your smile. Porcelain veneers are also a standout solution for teeth whitening, often used to address a range of dental concerns like chipped, crooked, or misaligned teeth. Veneers and teeth whitening go together like the stars and the moon, offering a shining combination for achieving a brighter, more radiant smile that lasts. Since veneers are custom-designed to fit over the front surface of your teeth, they effectively conceal your teeth discoloration rather than removing stains like traditional whitening treatments. If you’re looking for a long-lasting solution to teeth whitening, veneers are a great choice.

## Choosing Veneers for a Full and Brilliant Smile

If you’ve ever tried whitening strips, pens, or in-office whitening treatments, you know that the results don’t last forever—and often don’t deliver the desired whiteness. Unlike temporary whitening treatments that require frequent touch-ups, porcelain veneers are a more permanent solution to teeth whitening. For some people, even repeated whitening treatments don’t achieve the white and bright color they yearn for—either because their natural pigmentation has a gray or yellow cast or because of persistent damage due to medicines, vitamin deficiency, or aging. Dr. Aguil will guide you in choosing the ideal color for your smile based on your natural coloring and goals—one that is white and natural-looking rather than overpowering and artificial. Everyone has seen photos of people with glaringly white teeth that scream, “These aren’t real.” At Exquisite Dentistry, we consider the whole of you and our decades of experience to inform you of what will look best and most beautiful for you. In addition to improving the color of your teeth, porcelain veneers can also address other cosmetic concerns like uneven spacing, minor misalignment, or worn enamel, providing a comprehensive solution for enhancing your smile. What’s more, porcelain veneers are easy to care for. To keep your veneers looking their whitest, simply maintain good oral hygiene habits, including regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups.
