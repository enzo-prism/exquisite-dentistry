Title: 6 Early Signs of Oral Cancer

Oral cancer is easier to treat when we find it early. That is why regular dental visits include a simple screening. Between checkups, keep an eye out for these six warning signs and contact us if anything feels off.

1) A sore or lump that will not heal. Look for rough spots on your tongue, cheeks, lips, or the floor of your mouth. If a place stays tender, thick, or raised for more than two weeks, let us examine it.

2) Red, white, or speckled patches. Color changes in your mouth are often harmless, but new velvety patches need a professional look—especially if they peel, bleed, or sting.

3) Numbness or tingling. A sudden loss of feeling in your lips, chin, or inside the mouth can signal that something deeper is happening.

4) Persistent throat irritation. A scratchy throat, hoarse voice, or the feeling that something is stuck when you swallow deserve attention if they do not clear up soon.

5) Jaw or ear discomfort. Trouble chewing, opening wide, or ringing pain in one ear without hearing loss may be related to changes in your oral tissues.

6) A tooth that loosens unexpectedly. Teeth should not wiggle once they are fully grown. If one starts to shift without injury, schedule a visit.

These symptoms do not always mean cancer, but they do need a professional evaluation. During your appointment we use advanced light technology to spot concerns that the eye cannot see, giving you peace of mind. Call us if you notice any of these signs or if it has been a year since your last screening.
