## Top Oral Cancer Signs and Symptoms

If you’re looking for visual signs and symptoms of oral cancer, Dr. Aguil identifies six concerns you should be on the lookout for.

## Important Signs

1. **Sores, Lumps, or Thick Patches**

Oral cancer can occur anywhere in the mouth, including the tongue, lips, throat, pharynx, larynx, and salivary glands. Any swollen or eroded area with rough spots—especially on the lips and gums—could be an early indication of mouth cancer.

2. **Red or White Lesions**

Often appearing on the lips or inside the mouth, it’s important to notify your dentist of any velvety red, white, or speckled patches. Similarly, persistent sores on the mouth, neck, or face that bleed easily could be early signs of oral cancer.

3. **Bleeding or Numbness**

Oral cancer is sometimes characterized by unexplained bleeding or numbness in the mouth. This can also include pain, tenderness, or complete loss of feeling in the neck or face area.

4. **Ongoing Throat Soreness**

If you notice a sudden change in your voice or experience lingering hoarseness, it may be an early sign of mouth cancer. Some patients also report a persistent feeling that something is caught in the back of their throats.

5. **Pain in the Ear or Jaw**

Discomfort in the jaw or back of the tongue can be early signs of oral cancer. If you have trouble moving your mouth to speak, chew, or swallow, please consider scheduling an appointment with your dentist or doctor. Ear pain is also an indicator, especially when it occurs in one ear and isn’t associated with loss of hearing.

6. **Loose Teeth**

If one or more of your teeth begin to come loose with no obvious cause, oral cancer could be just one of the issues at work. It’s best to see your dentist right away! The sooner an expert can take a look, the better chance there is of saving the tooth.
