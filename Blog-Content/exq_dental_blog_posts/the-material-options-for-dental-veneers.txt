# The Material Options for Dental Veneers

## Overview

If you’re looking for an easy way to make extraordinary improvements to your smile, veneers are the perfect option. Dental veneers are thin, translucent coverings that are placed over the front of a tooth, instantly transforming a problematic tooth into a perfect one. Veneers are a wonderful fit for several types of cosmetic dentistry uses, including: Tooth discoloration:

## Although

teeth whitening is often a popular choice to achieve a whiter, brighter smile, veneers can accomplish the same job. Veneers are a good option when there are other issues to address along with tooth discoloration, allowing you to address multiple problems at the same time. Additionally, on the rare occasions there are tooth-coloring issues that cannot be solved through traditional whitening measures, veneers are also an appropriate choice. Cracked or chipped teeth: Although enamel is the hardest surface in the human body, it’s not impervious to cracking. If a tooth has cracked through eating, a blow to the mouth, or from some other trauma, a veneer may be helpful in these situations. Worn teeth: Those that grind their teeth will wear them down over time. When this occurs, veneers can restore the shape and function of the teeth. Gaps between teeth: If teeth are misshapen, or if they have small gaps between them, veneers are an option to restore function and beauty to the smile. How do you know if veneers are the best choice for your situation? When you visit your dentist, they will assess the issues that are hindering your smile from reaching its fullest potential and give you options for restoring the look and function of your teeth. If you deal with some of the conditions listed above, you’re likely a good candidate for dental veneers. Whether you need to transform a few teeth or all 32, high-quality veneers can be a game-changer. What Materials are Veneers Made Of? If you’re considering veneers, there’s an important choice you’ll need to make before you get too far in the process: you’ll need to select veneers made from either porcelain or composite resin. The type of material used for your veneers will in large part determine the overall outcome of your treatment. There are pros and cons to each option. Yet, at Exquisite Dentistry, we have a belief that one material is far superior to the other. Dr. Alexie Aguil has worked with patients who have experienced both types of veneers, and the feedback he’s received over the years has made it clear which option patients prefer.

## Veneer Material: Medical-Grade Porcelain

Many dentists prefer to use FDA-approved dental porcelain to fashion their veneers. Although some would point to their higher initial price, there are numerous advantages to porcelain veneers. Pros of Porcelain veneers: Offer a more natural look than composite resin Compare to the hardness of enamel, allowing them to be extremely resistant to chipping Last about ten years, but often last much longer with good oral care and regular dental checkups Can aid in fixing more serious cosmetic blemishes Extremely resistant to staining, meaning veneers will retain their color over time. A lower-cost option over the longer term, since they are more durable than less expensive materials used to create inexpensive veneers Cons of Composite veneers Come at a higher short-term investment Although porcelain veneer material represents a more significant initial investment than composite veneers, in the long run, you’ll have a better overall experience.

## Veneer Material: Composite Resin

Resin is a tooth-colored material that is shaped over the exterior of the tooth and then bonded in place. You’ll find that composite resin veneers are often found at a relatively low cost, and there are a couple of reasons for this: Compared to medical-grade porcelain, composite resin is less expensive material and process to use. Composite veneers can be placed over teeth in only one visit to the dentist, compared to three visits with porcelain. There are both positive and negative qualities of resin as the material for your veneers. Pros of Composite veneers Result in lower overall costs for the patient (in the short-term) More easily fixed or replaced if damaged Cons of Composite veneers Can discolor over time Not resistant to wear and tear like porcelain veneers Often lack a natural appearance, leading to a fake or plastic smile Choose Exquisite Dentistry for Porcelain Veneers Because of the all-encompassing look, feel, and outcome from porcelain veneers, Dr. Alexie Aguil only offers this veneer option at Exquisite Dentistry.
