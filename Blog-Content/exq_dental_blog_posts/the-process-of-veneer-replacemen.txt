Title: The Process of Veneer Replacement

Porcelain veneers can shine for many years, but eventually they may chip, stain, or lose their luster. When that happens, replacement keeps your smile looking fresh. Here is what to expect.

We start with an evaluation to check the bond, underlying tooth, and gum health. If replacement is needed, we gently remove the old veneer and take new digital impressions. This is your chance to adjust the shape or shade if you want a slightly different look.

Temporary veneers protect your teeth while the new porcelain is crafted. At the final visit we bond the updated veneers in place, refine the bite, and polish the edges. The process feels similar to getting your first set, and we use the same spa-like comforts to keep you relaxed.

To extend the life of your new veneers, brush and floss daily, avoid using your teeth as tools, wear a nightguard if you grind, and keep up with twice-yearly cleanings. Ready to refresh your smile? Schedule a consultation so we can plan your veneer update together. 

Dental veneers are an outstanding investment in your smile. They last many years with exceptional care. Just like natural teeth, they will show signs of wear over time. Then it’s time to consult a cosmetic dentist on veneer replacement.
Extending the Life of Your Veneers
Because they are a cosmetic procedure that health insurance companies don’t generally cover,
dental veneers
are usually a sizable investment for the patients who get them. So individuals who choose veneers should understand the following:
Veneers are not permanent, even those made with the highest-quality materials
Veneers can be broken, damaged, or stained, just like regular teeth
Patients that are vigilant about brushing, flossing and seeing their dentist for regular checkups and cleanings have the best results
People who stay vigilant about their oral care will prolong the life-span of their veneers. That could mean a few extra years before they need veneer replacement. Being dedicated to maintaining your veneers, your smile, and your oral health only takes a little extra effort.

Ways to Extend the Life of Your Veneers
Avoid using tobacco products and eating or drinking things that can stain teeth (pasta sauce, wine, coffee, dark soda, etc.)
Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and ask your dentist about a non-abrasive toothpaste that you can start using every day
Start wearing a mouthguard when playing sports (for protection) and wear a night guard when you sleep
Can you be perfect for the life of your veneers? That’s a tall order. You’ll likely get a soda at lunch here and there or jump into a game of basketball without your mouthguard at some point. However, keeping the investment value of your veneers in mind is usually enough motivation to keep them in the best shape possible.
The day will eventually come when your veneers need replacement. And at that point, you’ll need to talk to your dentist about the veneer replacement process.
Replacing Veneers: What to Expect
Getting a new set of veneers fitted is very much like getting your first veneers. Your dentist will remove the old veneers and buff the outer layer of the tooth.
With the old veneers removed, your dentist will take a new mold of your teeth and order the new veneers based on that mold to match your other teeth as closely as possible. This is the perfect time to change the design or shade of your smile if you want. Once the veneers have been created and shipped back to the dentist, they will attach the veneers to the teeth, just like the original procedure to get the veneers positioned for the perfect smile.
