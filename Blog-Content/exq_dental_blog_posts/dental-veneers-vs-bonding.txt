# Dental Veneers vs. Bonding

## Overview

It’s a dentist’s job to help you keep your teeth clean and healthy, but there is a whole lot more they can do. Cosmetic dentists specialize in treatments that help whiten teeth, repair damaged teeth, and even design the new smile you always wanted. The most skilled dentists use their years of expertise and specialized treatments to achieve these goals.

## Dental Veneers

are a superior option for a nearly flawless smile. They’re used to give teeth the ideal color and shape, mending damage or imperfections. Veneers are a durable material placed over your teeth to enhance their natural luminescence. In the hands of highly-skilled doctors, like Dr. Aguil, porcelain veneers are exceptionally long-lasting and natural-looking.

### Dental Bonding

is a similar treatment to the one used by dentists to fill cavities. It’s typically used to repair damaged teeth, and a more natural-looking alternative to metal fillings. The procedure uses a tooth-colored resin that hardens and bonds to teeth when exposed to a special curing light. While bonding can be used to achieve some of the same effects, veneers are recommended for the best results. Your dentist may use either or both as part of your cosmetic dental treatment.

### Dental Veneers

Veneers are thin-yet-durable pieces of porcelain material that are fitted to teeth using a strong bonding material. Your current teeth will be shaped to provide the most natural shape and position for the new veneers. Once applied, the veneers can improve the color of the teeth, as well as removing cracks, stains or gaps while aligning teeth into a more ideal position. The process generally takes about three visits to your dentist. Once you’re done, you’ll have a beautiful smile that will last for many years with proper care and regular visits to the dentist for hygiene check-ups and exams.

### Dental Bonding

Bonding starts with a malleable dental resin applied to the teeth. The process does not generally require any enamel to be removed. Once in place, the resin is hardened with a special light that binds it to the tooth. Bonding has a lot of potential benefits to help fill cavities, change the shape of teeth, or fill in gaps, but the hardened resin material is not as durable as the porcelain used in veneers. An expert cosmetic dentist will be able to show you the difference in using veneers vs. bonding for enhancing or restoring your smile.

## Bonding Isn’t for Everything

As versatile and reliable as bonding is, it can’t quite do everything veneers are used for. The dental resin is not as strong or durable as porcelain veneers—making it more susceptible to chipping. The resin material is also more porous than porcelain—making it more susceptible to stains and fading. For this reason, bonding is best used to fill dental cavities and to make small fixes or adjustments in teeth. Whether it’s dental veneers or bonding, a cosmetic dentist like Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry will select the best methods available to help you achieve your dream smile.
