Title: Dental Veneers vs. Bonding

Cosmetic dentistry offers several ways to refresh the look of your teeth. Two of the most common options are dental bonding and porcelain veneers. Both use tooth-colored materials, but they differ in how they are applied and how long they last.

Bonding is the quicker solution. We place a moldable resin on your tooth, gently shape it, and harden it with a curing light. Bonding works well when you need a small repair—closing a tiny gap, covering a chip, or touching up a single discolored spot. It rarely requires numbing and can usually be finished in a single visit. Because the resin is porous, it can stain and may need to be refreshed every few years.

Veneers take a little longer but deliver a bigger transformation. A veneer is a custom porcelain shell that covers the front of the tooth. By switching to porcelain, we can brighten stubborn discoloration, correct uneven shapes, and align your smile. Veneers resist stains better than bonding and often last a decade or more with good care.

Some patients choose a mix: bonding for minor tweaks and veneers for the teeth that show the most. During your consultation we will review your goals, the cost differences, and how each option fits into your long-term plan.

No matter which treatment you pick, we focus on keeping you comfortable and informed so you can enjoy a smile that feels like you.
