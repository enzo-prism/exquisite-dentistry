# 5 Ways to Improve Oral Care While You’re at Work

## Overview

As a child, losing a tooth is exciting. It marks a rite of passage—and results in a nifty reward from the tooth fairy. As an adult... not so much. Protecting your teeth is the key to keeping them in place all your life, and avoiding fillings, nerve damage, root canals, and similar procedures along the way. As an adult, one of the ways to take an extra step towards stellar oral health is by brushing your teeth at work. Dr. Aguil and his team at Exquisite Dentistry understand the struggle, and recommend 5 simple ways to make your workplace tooth brushing routine simple. So take a page from our book and follow these steps to take your tooth brushing to the office or job site. You’ll have fresher breath, and perpetually gorgeous pearly whites.

## Helpful Ways

1. **Stick to the Same Time Every Day**

Will you be brushing after lunch or an afternoon coffee break? Are you in the habit of using sugar-packed treats as a pick-me-up? If so, consider these times as the perfect opportunity for brushing teeth at work. Once you identify when you’ll be practicing this new daily ritual, put a recurring time in your calendar so you can stick to it.

2. **Prepare Your Tools**

Create a personal hygiene kit with everything you need to freshen up: a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, or even mouthwash. Use a small bag or mug to store and carry these tools to the bathroom. You’ll make the task of brushing your teeth at work more convenient and discreet. In a pinch, disposable mini-brushes are a quick, no-nonsense way to clean your teeth.

3. **Use the Buddy System**

If you’re nervous about being the only one in the office using the restroom for dental hygiene, recruit a coworker to join you. Not only will this make you feel more comfortable, but it will also hold you accountable to your new habit. Who knows, maybe you and your friend will start a teeth-cleaning movement in the office, and get more people to brush their teeth at work.

4. **Be Considerate**

Flossing at your desk? Please, no! Brushing in the break room? Oh my! Spitting into the same sink used by everyone else? No way! As hygienic as your new habit is, it can be perceived as unhygienic to others—and gross people out. So be considerate. Stick to the bathroom, throw discarded floss into the trash can (not the toilet) and run a paper towel around the sink when you’re done.

5. **Stay Strong**

Anytime you feel insecure or out of place brushing your teeth at work, remind yourself of the positive reasons you’re doing it in the first place and remain confident in your decision. Even if you feel awkward, push that feeling to the side. Over time, true confidence will build and your habit will feel normal in no time. Of course, brushing and flossing are just the first steps to good oral hygiene. A semi-annual cleaning is vital to ensure that your teeth and gums are healthy and strong. At Exquisite Dentistry, West Hollywood’s leading dental spa, your comfort and overall level of care are our highest priority. Whether you’re looking for laser teeth whitening, Invisalign clear aligners, or even comfortable sedation dentistry, you can be confident we have the technology and the skills necessary to help your smile shine brighter than ever.
