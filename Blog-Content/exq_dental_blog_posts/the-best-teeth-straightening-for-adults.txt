# The Best Teeth Straightening for Adults

## Overview

You can say a lot with a smile. That simple gesture shows that you’re happy, approachable, and relatable. A smile is an invitation to connect with someone personally and professionally. Everyone deserves to feel confident in their smile as a child and as an adult. At Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles, Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team have helped hundreds of adults to improve their smile through cosmetic dentistry. When it comes to straightening teeth for adults, his two most effective methods are Invisalign treatment and porcelain veneers.

## The Best Methods for Teeth Straightening

For many, crooked teeth are the biggest obstacle preventing adults from having an A-list smile. Traditional braces are the first thing we think about when it comes to adult teeth straightening. Our second thought typically goes to former classmates in our younger years who had their braces for years. If braces for adult teeth are keeping you from perfecting your smile, there are better ways to do it. A cosmetic dentist like Dr. Alexie Aguil can work with you to find an option like Invisalign that works for you and your lifestyle.

## Top Teeth Straightening Treatments

### Invisalign Clear Aligners

Traditional and lingual braces work. But there is one method that works faster and more comfortably, and you can even take them out to eat and take photos. For most, the best method for straightening your teeth is Invisalign. Invisalign has been rapidly gaining popularity and earning praise over the last 20 years. Dr. Alexie Aguil, one of the leading providers of Invisalign in the United States, praises its teeth straightening technology and superiority over traditional braces for adult teeth. Invisalign is efficient at correcting your smile without self-consciousness slowing you down. Life doesn’t have to change just because you’re straightening your teeth. Every day, your dream smile gets closer to reality, and the people around you may not even notice. You’ll visit your dentist only often enough to be fitted for new aligners, each one straighter than the last as they work their magic.

### How Invisalign Works

At Exquisite Dentistry, your journey towards straighter teeth starts on day one. With our advanced scanning technology, you’ll be able to see what your teeth will look like after treatment is complete. You’ll be sent a set of clear aligners every week. This teeth-straightening process continues until the desired results are achieved, sometimes in as little as 6 months. Treatment can be flexible to keep your mouth comfortable. Some Invisalign patients report slight discomfort when wearing their new aligners, but generally, Invisalign is a painless process. Your teeth can even be shifted one at a time in order to alleviate some discomfort. Exquisite Dentistry is also one of the few practices that offers Fast Track™ Aligner Accelerator. Patients can be proud of their smiles in less time, all thanks to a specialized dental practice they can trust. It’s easy to see why so many celebrities and professionals are turning to Invisalign for straighter teeth instead of braces.

### Porcelain Veneers

Dental veneers are a great fix for damaged, misaligned, or discolored teeth, as well as teeth with unwanted gaps. With only 3 appointments required, veneers are one of the quickest ways of straightening adult teeth. At Exquisite Dentistry, patients can achieve their perfect smile in just three simple visits as opposed to months of teeth-straightening visits for traditional braces. Veneers are made from thin porcelain and placed over existing teeth for natural-looking results. Digital scans are taken of the teeth in need of correction, giving patients a chance to work with Dr. Aguil to help design their ideal smile. A small section of the tooth is buffed down and replaced by a temporary until the permanent porcelain veneers arrive. Patients with veneers can eat with and brush their teeth just like they normally would. For adults wanting straighter teeth, there’s no other method this easy, or with better results.

## Traditional Braces Aren’t for Everyone

Besides being indiscreet, traditional braces are often uncomfortable and inconvenient. While lingual braces are harder to spot, the lisp they cause is often more prominent. For professionals in need of a jaw-dropping smile without the obvious signs, traditional braces for adults are not the way to go. The frequent maintenance needed for both types of braces often leaves patients frustrated. They’ll also need to take extra steps when brushing and flossing. By Contrast, clear aligners and porcelain veneers are easy to care for. Your clear aligners can be cleaned or even removed before bed. And veneers can be brushed and flossed like any other tooth.
