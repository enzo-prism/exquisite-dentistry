Title: Restoration and Maintenance for Dental Veneers

Porcelain veneers can keep your smile bright for a decade or more when you care for them properly. After your veneers are placed, follow these simple habits to protect their shine.

• Brush twice a day with a soft toothbrush and non-abrasive toothpaste. Floss gently along the gumline to remove plaque and protect the edges of your veneers.
• Avoid biting into hard items like ice, nutshells, or pens. Use scissors to open packages and keep chewy foods in small pieces.
• If you grind or clench, wear a nightguard. Protect your veneers with a custom mouthguard during sports or high-impact activities.
• Visit us twice a year for cleanings and checkups. We will polish your veneers, check the bond, and catch any concerns early so small adjustments keep them looking their best.

For patients looking for a beautiful, radiant smile, dental veneer restoration may be the answer. Veneers are translucent, yet durable pieces of porcelain that are bonded to the front of teeth to enhance their color and shape, as well as fix damage. They can also close gaps between teeth.
Veneers are a relatively simple solution to transforming a smile in 3 visits to your cosmetic dentist. High-quality porcelain veneers often last many years, and can last 20 years with proper care. Then, it’s time for a
cosmetic dentist
to help restore them.
Veneer restoration
typically involves three visits to the dentist. During the first visit, your cosmetic dentist will make a mold of your teeth. On your second visit, temporary veneers will be applied to your teeth, allowing you to “test drive” your selection. At the final visit, you’ll have the temporary veneers removed and the permanent veneers bonded into place. Before you know it, you’ll be on your way with a brand new,
stunning smile
!
Proper veneer maintenance is the best way to get the most out of your new smile. By making proper veneer maintenance a priority, you can get additional years out of their lifespan.

Dr. Alexie Aguil
works hard to make sure that patients get the highest-quality veneers possible. Once you leave the office after your final veneer restoration appointment, there are several steps you need to take to ensure you’ll get the most out of your new smile. Consider these five tips to help you maintain your new veneers.
1. Brush and Floss
This may seem like common sense, but it’s vitally important to regularly brush and floss. By cleaning away the plaque, you can avoid tartar buildup that hinders the look of your veneers. Cleaning food particles out of your teeth and gums will help prevent dental caries, as well as an infection.
When you’re brushing and flossing, don’t forget to:
Brush two by two.
This means you need to brush for two minutes in the morning and two minutes in the evening. Don’t cut the time short; set a timer to ensure you don’t shortchange your brushing time.
Use a proper toothbrush.
Just as a carpenter needs to have the proper tools when they work, you need the right tool for maintaining your veneer restoration. A soft to medium bristle is best for the job. Additionally, make sure you change your brush every three months or sooner if the bristles are worn.
Floss once a day.
Many people neglect to floss, which is a detriment to their veneers and their overall oral health. For ease of use, many people prefer to use pre-strung floss picks.
2. Use Your Teeth the Right Way
We’ve all used our teeth for something we shouldn’t have at one time or another. Whether it’s tearing open a package, chewing ice, or as an impromptu tool, we’ve all made the mistake before.
Misuse of your teeth can be harmful to your oral health. For those with veneer restoration, it can be even more damaging. Proper veneer upkeep requires that you don’t use your teeth as tools for anything besides eating. Although veneers are firmly bonded to your teeth, they’re not impervious to misuse. Take care of your veneers, and they’ll take care of you!
3. Avoid Grinding Your Teeth
Porcelain veneers are extremely durable. They’re almost as resilient as your natural enamel. Those who deal with
bruxism
(teeth grinding) should understand that even these hard surfaces can be worn down over time due to constant teeth grinding.
If you deal with teeth grinding, have an honest conversation with your dentist before receiving veneer restoration treatment. They can offer a solution like a dental mouth guard, which can keep the teeth from grinding. Your dentist can also offer other alternate solutions, such as stress management or biofeedback to help deal with the problem at its root cause.
4. Use a Mouthguard for Sports
Do you enjoy playing in a local rec league? How about your company’s softball team? No matter your sport of choice, everyone should make sure they utilize a well-fitting mouthpiece. However, this is even more important if you have had veneer restoration.
Speak to your dentist about having a custom-fitted mouthguard created for you to aid in proper veneer upkeep.
5. Visit the Dentist Regularly
It would be a shame to have a beautiful veneer restoration and then neglect to see the dentist for your semi-annual
teeth cleaning and exam
. Unfortunately, patients routinely miss their twice-a-year visit to the dentist. By doing so, they limit the overall lifespan of their veneers.
Before you leave the office from your final veneer appointment, make sure you schedule your next six-month checkup. If you wait until later to call, you’ll likely forget. Many patients are shocked that it’s been two or three years since their last exam, simply because time got away from them. Your veneers deserve better, so keep on a regular examination schedule.
