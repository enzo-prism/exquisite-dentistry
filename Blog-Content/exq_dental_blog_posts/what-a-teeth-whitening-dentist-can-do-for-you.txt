Title: What a Teeth Whitening Dentist Can do for You

Professional whitening delivers brighter results than over-the-counter strips or toothpastes. During your visit we evaluate your teeth, discuss your goals, and recommend the safest way to lift stains while protecting your enamel.

Our in-office Zoom! treatment brightens your smile by several shades in about an hour. We apply a protective barrier to your gums, brush on a professional-strength gel, and activate it with a gentle light to break up stains from coffee, tea, wine, or aging.

If you are looking for a full smile makeover, we can pair whitening with other cosmetic options like veneers or bonding to cover deep discoloration or reshape chips. No matter which route you choose, regular cleanings help maintain your results and keep new stains from settling.

Everyone wants a beautiful Hollywood smile. There are plenty of at-home remedies, but they’re often ineffective toothpastes, messy trays, or sloppy bleach gels that just don’t give the best results.
If you want your teeth to lighten by several shades, teeth whitening at the dentist’s office is your best choice. A skilled dentist can help you quickly and safely brighten your smile. There are several ways that a dentist may whiten your teeth, and your dentist will work with you to tailor your treatment to get the results you’re looking for.
How a Dentist Can Whiten Your Teeth
Here at Exquisite Dentistry of Los Angeles,
Dr. Alexie Aguil
has been
transforming smiles
for years. If you visit his dentist’s office for teeth whitening, he’ll typically recommend one of three treatment options.
Zoom! Advanced Teeth Whitening
Zoom! Whitening is advanced
laser teeth whitening
that delivers the quickest and most noticeable results of any whitening method. The best teeth-whitening dentists choose Zoom as their preferred treatment method.
Here’s how it works. First, your teeth will be thoroughly cleaned to remove tartar buildup and maximize the teeth whitening effects. A whitening gel will be applied to your teeth. Then, your dentist will shine the Zoom! Light on your teeth to remove stains and discoloration.
The entire process takes about 60 minutes and safely brightens even the most sensitive of teeth. Zoom! Advanced teeth whitening treatment is how a dentist can whiten your teeth by up to 8 shades in a single visit!

Porcelain Veneers
In situations where patients are looking to make more significant cosmetic changes to their smile, Dr. Aguil may recommend
porcelain veneers
. These thin, translucent porcelain pieces create the natural look of bright white teeth while helping to repair damage, and giving them the ideal shape.
Porcelain veneers typically require three visits to the dentist for teeth whitening:
Visit one:
Dr. Aguil will consult with you about your goals for your smile. If you’d like to move forward with veneers, he’ll make a digital impression of your teeth. He’ll send these measurements to one of the most prestigious dental ceramists on the West Coast. Together, they’ll begin to hand craft your veneers.
Visit two:
Temporary veneers are placed over your treated teeth. These short-term coverings will help determine the ideal fit and feel you’re looking for. Changes to the final veneers can be made during this “try-in” period to assure that your smile design will be the smile that works best for you.
Visit three:
The temporary veneers are removed and the finished porcelain veneers are securely bonded to your teeth.
Veneers will often last ten years or more with proper care. During your next dentist visit,  Dr. Aguil can consult with you about whether you’re a good candidate for high-quality porcelain veneers, as well as use
advanced technology
to show you what your smile will look like when treatment is complete.
General Teeth Cleaning & Care
When was the last time you had your
semi-annual cleaning
? Before recommending other treatments, Your teeth will be cleaned with state-of-the-art methods and technology. Many patients find that this cleaning will help gently remove light stains on their teeth, especially if they haven’t kept up twice-yearly dentist visits.
At your cleaning, a dental hygienist will gently sweep away plaque and tartar that have built up on your teeth over time. In just a few minutes, you’ll achieve a brighter, healthier smile! Even if you’ve already decided on laser whitening, regular cleaning and care are how a dentist can whiten your teeth and keep them that way.
