Title: Choosing Veneers for the Front 4 Teeth

Porcelain veneers can transform your top front teeth into a bright, even smile. If you are mostly concerned about the four teeth that show the most—your central and lateral incisors—we can focus treatment there while keeping your smile natural.

We usually recommend treating all the teeth that show when you grin so the color and shape match perfectly. Still, there are moments when four veneers make sense. If those teeth have chips, old bonding, or noticeable gaps, veneers can smooth the edges and align your smile without changing the rest of your mouth.

During your consultation we evaluate your bite, the way light reflects off your teeth, and the shades that will blend best. We also talk through whether adding veneers to nearby teeth would give you an even more seamless look.

The treatment visits are straightforward. We take digital scans, prepare the teeth gently, place temporary veneers, and then bond the final porcelain pieces once the lab finishes crafting them.

Quality matters as much as quantity. Investing in well-made veneers ensures they stay strong, resist stains, and look like natural enamel. Our spa-inspired office keeps you relaxed while we focus on the details that make your smile shine. Book a visit to see if four front veneers—or a broader plan—fits your goals.
