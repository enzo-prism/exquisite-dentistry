Title: How Sweet: Ideas for Keeping Teeth Healthy On Valentine’s Day

Valentine’s Day can still be sweet without leaving your teeth coated in sugar. Plan a cozy dinner at home featuring crunchy veggies, lean proteins, and fruit for dessert. Foods like strawberries, apples, and cheese help rinse away acids and keep your smile fresh for that end-of-the-night kiss.

If you exchange gifts, pair traditional treats with something smile-friendly. A new electric toothbrush, a set of flavored floss picks, or a whitening session you can enjoy together makes the gesture feel personal and thoughtful.

Finish the evening with a quick brush and floss so sugar does not linger overnight. Want to go the extra mile? Schedule a couples cleaning or whitening at our office for a lasting gift that keeps you both smiling long after the holiday. 

Valentine’s Day is all about setting aside some time to be with your significant other and, for some, exchanging sugary treats. Whether you pick up a box of themed candy, or choose a sampler with dozens of assorted chocolates, February 14th has always been a day where it just feels right to sweeten things up. Chocolate is one of the more popular choices, and is considered to be a powerful aphrodisiac—but it’s also packed with sugar, and we don’t have to tell you it’s not tooth-friendly. But hey, it’s your day with your sweetheart, so we say indulge and enjoy!
Ok, dental health doesn’t sound sexy, but maybe that kiss will be. That’s why we are dedicated to helping you keep yours as healthy it can be. Here’s a few healthy Valentine’s Day ideas from
Dr. Aguil
at Exquisite Dentistry.
Cooking Together
Making a meal with someone special is a fun way to spend your Valentine’s Day. This also gives you the opportunity to incorporate healthy ingredients—so you can focus on foods that taste great and doesn’t hurt your teeth. Recipes that contain lots of vegetables, cheeses, meats, and crunchy fruits are best for keeping teeth clean and strong.
For example, green leafy veggies such as kale and spinach are full of calcium and phosphorus—two minerals that are essential in strengthening tooth enamel. Cheese also contains calcium, and was reported by the
American Academy of General Dentistry
to raise pH levels in the mouth, which lowers your risk of tooth decay.
Fruits contain sugar, but the effects are diluted by the high water content that helps fight bacteria. The greatest benefit from fruits such as apples and pears comes their fiber, which can also give your teeth a good scrubbing before and after a meal. So, if spending the day together in the kitchen sounds good, find a tasty recipe and get cooking!

After Dinner
Maybe cooking isn’t your thing, or you’re looking for a healthy Valentine’s Day idea that’s more tangible. Or perhaps you want a way to freshen up after a fancy, romantic dinner. There are dozens of dental products that you can give your partner on Valentine’s Day to maintain and improve dental health—and overall wellness.
Put together a gift basket with an electric or manual toothbrush, floss, a favorite flavor of toothpaste, and even a teeth-whitening kit. Brushing, flossing, and at-home whitening are activities you can do together, and will motivate you to take better care of your teeth—especially if you hold each other accountable. The couple that flosses together, stays together—or so we hear!
Of course, it probably goes without saying, but if you’re getting your partner a gift basket to promote their oral care, you better also get them something more romantic too!
