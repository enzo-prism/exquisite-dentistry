### Dr. Aguil

answers questions about chipped teeth on a regular basis. He’s listed some of the most common questions he hears at his Los Angeles office and his answers to these important queries. “I Chipped My Tooth. How Bad Is It?” The first question Dr. Aguil usually fields from concerned patients is about the extent of the damage to the tooth. Because tooth damage occurs for a variety of reasons, there are several types of injuries to look out for. Craze lines are minor surface cracks that develop on the enamel of your tooth, which may not require treatment. This is the best-case scenario in dealing with a cracked or chipped tooth. Broken cusps involve damage to the chewing surface of your teeth. Though not painful, these injuries may require reshaping and crowns. Minor chips are usually not too painful but may need to be repaired with polishing and/or filling.

### A

cracked tooth consists of damage to your whole tooth—from the enamel to the root. If left untreated, the crack can worsen over time and become a split tooth. The crack may also be harboring bacteria that can lead to cavities—potentially infecting the root and leading to more extensive treatments, such as root canal therapy and a dental crown.

### Cavities

can weaken your teeth, resulting in decay-induced breaks. Following the recommendation of your dentist and hygienist, we can detect cavities before extensive treatments are needed. This is the best way to avoid cavities is to ensure you are keeping your semi-annual dental cleaning appointments.

How Do I Care For It?” If you’ve damaged one or more of your teeth, schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as you can. If it’s a dental emergency, they may be able to fit you in sooner. In the meantime, follow these simple instructions if you’re still not sure what to do with your chipped tooth: Clean out your mouth with lukewarm water. Water that is too hot or too cold could cause significant pain to any exposed nerves in the pulp of the cracked tooth. If you notice bleeding as a result of a damaged tooth, apply pressure to the injured area using clean gauze. Maintain gentle pressure until the bleeding has subsided. Protect the affected tooth until your upcoming dentist appointment. Dental cement is an effective temporary solution and can be found at most drugstores or big-box retailers like Target or Walmart. Orajel can topically dull the pain of a chipped or cracked tooth, but you should use any type of medication with caution. Check with your dentist before using any over-the-counter dental products. If the damage causes pain that a topical medication cannot alleviate, take an over-the-counter pain reliever like Tylenol or Advil. Be sure to follow instructions carefully to take the proper dosage. Eat only soft foods and avoid using the chipped tooth to chew. “I Chipped My Tooth. What Will the Dentist Do?” Your treatment will depend on the severity of your injury. For a minor chip, the dentist may polish the affected tooth to make its surface smoother and less likely to cut the inside of your mouth. For extensive damage—when your tooth’s nerve is exposed, for example—the dentist may recommend a root canal and a crown to replace the broken tooth. The only way a dentist will know what to do with a chipped tooth is by viewing the tooth and possibly taking X-rays of the affected area. For many chipped teeth, your dentist will use a veneer or crown to restore your smile’s natural beauty—and to protect inner layers from further damage, including infection. Following treatment, it is important to maintain a consistent routine of brushing and flossing, and regular visits to your dentist. “I Chipped My Tooth?
