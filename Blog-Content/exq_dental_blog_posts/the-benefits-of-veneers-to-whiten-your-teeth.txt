# The Benefits of Veneers to Whiten Your Teeth

## Overview

Dental veneers are an effective treatment to design your smile exactly the way you want. They’re often used to help fix a chipped tooth, a gap between teeth, or even make a tiny adjustment to the bite of a person’s mouth. For the best whitening benefits, nothing beats porcelain veneers. Unlike veneers of other types, they’re virtually indistinguishable from natural teeth. Porcelain veneers are expected to last 7-15 years, which means that with proper cleanings, your new smile can stay bright for a decade or more before they must be fixed or replaced.

## Veneers for Teeth Whitening at Exquisite Dentistry

The veneers provided at Exquisite Dentistry are custom-made from the highest quality porcelain. Porcelain is a sturdy material that naturally resists stains and can be kept clean and bright with the same brushing and flossing that you are already doing on your normal teeth. As a result, veneer whitening refers to the visual impact that your new veneers will have on your smile.
