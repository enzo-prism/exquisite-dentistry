Title: Can Damaged Teeth Repair Themselves Naturally?

Teeth are strong, but they do not heal the way skin or bone does. Once a cavity, crack, or deep chip forms, the body cannot rebuild the lost enamel. You might see articles about new stem cell research, and the science is exciting, but it is still years away from everyday dental care.

Right now, the safest way to protect a damaged tooth is with professional treatment. Small cavities can be repaired with tooth-colored fillings. Larger cracks or broken edges often need a crown, veneer, or bonding to prevent further splitting. Addressing issues early keeps you comfortable and helps you avoid infections or extractions later on.
