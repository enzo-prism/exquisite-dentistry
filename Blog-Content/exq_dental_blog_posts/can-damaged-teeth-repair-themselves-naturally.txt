# Can Damaged Teeth Repair Themselves Naturally?

## Overview

Do teeth naturally heal over time? The thought of someone’s teeth regenerating sounds like science fiction to most. But it’s not as far-fetched as you may think. Dentistry is evolving. According to a recent study from the journal Scientific Reports, researchers may be able to stimulate stem cells in your teeth to naturally repair defects—including cavities, cracks, chips, and more. Though no clinical studies have been conducted on people as of yet, experts are hopeful that these findings will dramatically impact the future of dental care. When a tooth suffers damage, it loses something called dentin—the hard, bony tissue underneath the enamel that forms the bulk of the tooth. Each tooth’s stem cells produce new dentin, in an attempt to repair the damage. However, this innate repair mechanism has its limits and can only manufacture small amounts of tissue while combating a cavity, injury, or infection. This is why, under normal circumstances, teeth cannot heal themselves. In today’s world, that’s where dentists like Dr. Alexie Aguil work to restore damaged teeth to tip-top shape to prevent further damage and infection—and reinvigorate your smile. But researchers believe this new method of stimulating tooth stem cells will “greatly enhance” the natural repair of teeth when supported by Tideglusib, a drug commonly used to treat Alzheimer’s disease.

After drilling holes into subjects’ molars, scientists stimulated the teeth’s stem cells with a group of molecules found in Tideglusib. Within six weeks, the mice regenerated much the dentin lost in their teeth. The ultimate goal, according to researcher Paul Sharpe, is to stimulate stem cells enough to “regenerate a whole tooth.” If possible, stem cell treatments could eventually replace traditional cosmetic procedures.
