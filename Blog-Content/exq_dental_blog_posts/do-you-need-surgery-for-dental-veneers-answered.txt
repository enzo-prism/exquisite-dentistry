Title: Do You Need Surgery for Dental Veneers? (Answered!)

Veneers do not require surgery. They are thin porcelain shells that we bond to the front of your teeth to improve color, shape, and alignment. The entire process happens right in the dental chair with local numbing and gentle preparation.

Here is what to expect:

• Consultation: We examine your teeth, discuss your goals, and design the size and shade of your veneers. Digital scans capture every detail so the lab can craft a perfect fit.

• Temporary preview: We prepare the teeth by removing a thin layer of enamel and place temporary veneers. You wear them for a short time to make sure the look and feel are right.

• Final placement: Once the porcelain veneers arrive, we bond them in place, polish the edges, and confirm your bite. You leave with an instantly brighter smile.

Some patients may combine veneers with other treatments—like gum contouring or orthodontics—to get the best result, but veneers alone do not involve surgical incisions. If you are curious about how the experience feels, schedule a consultation. We will walk you through every step and tailor the plan to your comfort.
