## Overview

Fact or Fiction: Do You Need Surgery for Dental Veneers? Dental veneers are an excellent option for those looking to enhance their smile and correct dental issues. These thin, meticulously crafted porcelain shells fit over your natural teeth to conceal imperfections and discoloration. In just a few visits to your dentist, teeth that were once chipped, misshapen, or stained are transformed. But you might be wondering, do you need surgery for dental veneers? The answer is no. The process of applying veneers does not involve surgery and is much simpler than you might imagine. Keep in mind, that doesn’t mean surgery is never used. In some cases, surgery may be needed to achieve optimal results. Exquisite Dentistry offers some of the finest veneer treatments for those living in the Los Angeles area. Led by Dr. Alexie Aguil, Exquisite Dentistry has been helping patients achieve the smile of their dreams with veneers for over two decades.

## The Porcelain Veneer Process

If you’re concerned about surgery for porcelain veneers, there’s no need to worry because there’s no cutting or incisions. In fact, the veneer process may be quite painless. Let’s go over the steps it takes to achieve a brilliant smile with veneers at our cosmetic dental practice in West Hollywood: Initial consultation Before discussing treatment options, Dr. Aguil recommends a teeth cleaning and exam to determine if porcelain veneers are the right option for you. Next, using cutting-edge equipment, Dr. Aguil takes a 3D image of your bite. These images guide the creation of your veneers for a tailored fit that matches your unique dental structure. You’ll discuss your needs and preferences with Dr. Aguil during the consultation. Together, you’ll specify your veneers’ desired shape and color, ensuring that the final result aligns with your expectations and complements your facial features.

### Temporary Restorations

After your first visit, Dr. Aguil sends the digital impressions of your teeth to a top dental laboratory for fabrication. Before your final veneers are ready, Dr. Aguil applies temporary restorations. These short-term veneers will show you how your permanent veneers will look and feel. You’ll try them out for a few weeks to ensure you like your veneers’ look, shape, and feel before permanent application. Should fine-tuning be necessary, Dr. Aguil will work with the lab to adjust and refine your permanent veneers to meet your preferences and ensure optimal comfort. While surgery remains unnecessary for veneers, it’s important to note that Dr. Aguil will expertly shape your teeth for application to accommodate a precise fit.

### Permanent Application

Once your permanent veneers are delivered from the lab, Dr. Aguil permanently bonds them to your teeth. The veneer application process is quick and gentle. Before you know it, you’re on your way out of the office with a brand-new smile and a newfound confidence.
