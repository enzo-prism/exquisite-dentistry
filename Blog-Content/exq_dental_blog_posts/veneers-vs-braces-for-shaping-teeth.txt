# Veneers vs. Braces for Shaping Teeth

## Overview

Should you choose dental veneers or braces to shape your teeth and align your bite? This is ultimately a discussion to have between you and your dentist, but it always helps to prepare yourself with information. If you live in the area of Los Angeles, California, then Dr. Alexie Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry can help you determine the best treatment for a radiant smile. And even if not, we’d be happy to share our insights to help you learn more and decide together with a dentist near you. What are Dental Veneers? Dental veneers are a thin material that a dentist can adhere to teeth for restoring damage, adjusting their shape, and improving their overall look. The highest quality porcelain veneers applied by a skilled cosmetic dentist will look and feel natural. What are Dental Braces? Dental braces are devices that gently push and reposition teeth over time. Traditional metallic braces are kept in the mouth and readjusted (tightened) until the right alignment is reached. Invisalign treatment is a popular alternative to metallic braces. Invisalign uses a series of clear aligners that can be removed when you eat, or for other activities. But even when you take photos, you probably won’t even see them. That’s the beauty of Invisalign.

## A Complete Change to Bite Registration

Both of these treatments may completely change the alignment of your teeth and the shape of your bite. This makes them both effective at treating misaligned teeth and closing gaps between teeth. But there are a few benefits to one or the other depending on the results you’re looking for.

## The Benefits of Dental Veneers vs. Braces

In addition to aligning your teeth, porcelain veneers are an excellent treatment for enhancing their overall appearance. When treatment is done through a top cosmetic dentist, such as here at Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles, the advanced ceramic materials will give you the look and feel of natural teeth. Additionally, dental veneers can be used to adjust the actual shape of the teeth themselves, not just their alignment or position in your mouth. The process for dental veneers typically takes 3-4 trips to the dentist. You can see the desired results much more quickly than with braces in as little as a couple weeks.

## The Benefits of Dental Braces vs. Veneers

Dental braces or Invisalign treatments are best used for substantial alignment or spacing issues. Patients have teeth that don’t line up properly at all and can even be experiencing discomfort in their mouth or jaw. This misalignment of teeth (called malocclusion) can lead to wear and tear on your teeth, gums and even bone that isn’t normal and can lead to worse issues down the line. The Invisalign system incorporates a series of high definition 3D aligners, each custom-made for the patient, that shift teeth to the desired position with each step forward throughout the series. Before you even have to wear your first aligner, you’ll get to view your final smile using our advanced iTero scanner right in Dr. Aguil’s office. It only takes a few minutes to scan your mouth, then create a 3D movie of what the end results will look like.

## With You From Start to Finish

The best way to determine what to choose between veneers vs. braces is to schedule an appointment with Exquisite Dentistry. In your first consultation, we’ll analyze your smile and bite, and then find the best steps to get them where you want them to be. A consultation with Dr. Aguil is the first step to getting the smile you’ve always wanted. He will look at the health of your teeth and determine the best course of treatment based on your individual desires. With your final goal in mind, he will break down the best way to achieve it—be it with porcelain veneers or Invisalign braces. Invisalign can be used to align your smile, but veneers may also be added after treatment for certain issues that braces cannot resolve, such as discoloration of the natural teeth. Dr. Aguil can use veneers to reshape and therefore change your bite into the natural position that Invislign would. However, using veneers, he can also create the best elements of a Hollywood smile. The discussion of “veneers vs. braces” can instead become “veneers OR braces” or even “veneers AND braces,” depending on your needs.
