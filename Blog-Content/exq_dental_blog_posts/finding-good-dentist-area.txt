# Finding a good dentist in your area

## Overview

If you’ve moved recently or simply want a change and are searching for a new dentist, the process can be overwhelming. Googling the long list of doctors on Yelp doesn’t help, because it tells you nothing about their chairside manner, philosophy on patient care, and expertise. The path to finding a good dentist in your area begins with paying attention to word of mouth and written reviews. Whether you’re in need of a general cleaning or more major dental work like a root canal, who better to recommend a dentist than someone who’s recently spent time in their exam room? Once you’ve picked a doctor, it’s a good idea to make a list of questions and schedule a time to sit down with him or her to discuss them. Most of us experience at least mild anxiety regarding visiting the dentist, and meeting the doctor ahead of time in relaxed atmosphere can help ease this fear. Making the search easier If you have dental insurance, another one of the best ways to find a dentist in your area is with a list of qualifying doctors from your plan. Like Yelp, this still isn’t going to give you a detailed review of the dentist’s practice, but it helps narrow down the list of candidates. When reading reviews and asking around for referrals, make sure to ask about the office team. Each time you visit the office, you’ll be interacting not just with the doctor but with the folks at the front desk, the hygienist and the person in charge of billing. A happy, relaxed and friendly team tells you a lot about the dentist. The atmosphere in any office starts from the top.
