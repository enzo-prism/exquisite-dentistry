# Choosing Veneers or Implants for Your Teeth

## Overview

An experienced cosmetic dentist can do wonders for your smile. The options you have with modern dental technology are simply transformative. Porcelain veneers are thin, but durable strips of material placed over the teeth for a brilliant natural-looking color and shape. They’re often used to whiten and re-shape teeth into your ideal smile. Veneers are often used in conjunction with dental implants to create a fantastic smile while replacing missing or damaged teeth. Cosmetic dentist, Dr. Alexie Aguil uses both porcelain veneers and dental implants for his treatments at Exquisite Dentistry of Los Angeles. His experience makes him the perfect person to answer your questions about veneers and implants. If you’re in the LA area and considering one of these options to improve your smile, then call to schedule your consultation. What Are Dental Veneers? Veneers are a sophisticated treatment option that helps address issues that prevent a patient from feeling good about smiling. And smiling is so important to feeling good about yourself.. Porcelain veneers can cover cracks and chips, as well as rejuvenate discolored teeth. They can straighten crooked teeth and fill gaps between teeth. Dr. Aguil has partnered with one of the best dental laboratories on the West Coast to help create veneers with a natural, seamless look. Your treatment will take place over 3 visits that include:

## The Initial Consultation:

Dr. Aguil will give you a complete exam and cleaning to start your appointment. Then, he’ll use our advanced 3D Orthophos SL Cone Beam to take a digital map of your mouth. Together, you’ll discuss options including the shape and color of your veneers, and our technology will show you what your smile will look like before you even get started! It’s often helpful if you bring a photo of a smile that you would like to have! It will help in the discussion of your ideal smile.

### The Follow-Up Visit:

Before your final veneers are created, Dr. Aguil will place temporary veneers over your teeth. He’ll do this by shaping individual teeth to create the best surface to help each veneer hold securely to your teeth. Then, he’ll place the temporary veneers on top of the teeth. You will probably love them immediately. But Dr. Aguil wants you to love them for the long term. During the try-in period, you will be communicating with him what you like best about the temporary veneers. Dr. Aguil will make adjustments if needed to create the ideal veneer for function and beauty.

### The Final Visit:

Your temporary veneers are removed and the custom-made veneers are securely bonded in place. You’re all set, and your veneers will give you years of beautiful smiles. Just like that, your smile is transformed. That’s why so many patients choose veneers!

### What Are

### Implants

? Implants are a modern solution to replace teeth. Don’t worry if you’re missing a tooth or need to have a damaged tooth removed, Dr. Aguil may recommend dental implants. The process is much different than getting veneers, but the results are very similar – a beautiful smile! What are dental implants? They’re artificial roots made of titanium which replace the structure of the missing tooth. Dental implants are often preferred over a dental bridge that anchors to the teeth on either side. An oral surgeon is needed for implants, and Dr. Aguil partners with a highly skilled surgeon who is near his West Hollywood office. The treatment itself will be done with your absolute comfort in mind, and can be done with local anesthetic. But gentle sedation is also available to make it completely pain-free. Your jaw may be sore for as long as a few months following your implant, and this is easily managed with over the counter medication. Once the implant is in place, you’ll meet with Dr. Aguil and prepare your final restoration. He’ll gently remove the healing cap and make the proper measurements, ensuring that your replacements will fit exactly as they should. As soon as recovery is complete, Dr. Aguil will complete the restorative process. He’ll take the newly-crafted crown, bridge, or dentures and affix them to the implants. When the process is complete, your smile will be happy and healthy once again. Dr. Aguil trained at the Ross Nash Institute for Dental Learning, and his extensive experience with implants makes him the natural choice for patients who end up choosing this option. He’ll place your restorations securely in your mouth, ensuring you’ll have no problems either speaking or eating.

## Do I Need to Choose Between

### Veneers

or Implants? The answer is no. If you’re missing a tooth, your options are generally between a dental implant or a dental bridge. Once your implant or bridge is in place you’ll work with Dr. Aguil or your local cosmetic dentist to select a dental crown to place on top of the implant or bridge. That crown will be made for the ideal color and shape, just like a veneer would be.
