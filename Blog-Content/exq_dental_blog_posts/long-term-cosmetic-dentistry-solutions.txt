Title: Long term cosmetic dentistry solutions

Lasting cosmetic dentistry focuses on both beauty and strength. Treatments like porcelain veneers, crowns, tooth-colored fillings, bonding, and implants repair damage while blending naturally with your smile. Each option restores function so you can eat, speak, and laugh with confidence for years to come.

When you visit our office, we begin with a full evaluation—digital images, periodontal checks, and a conversation about your goals. Together we create a plan that may include whitening, Invisalign, or restorative work to bring every tooth into harmony.

Comfort is a priority. We use gentle techniques, calming amenities, and sedation options when needed so you can relax during longer visits. After treatment, we schedule follow-ups to keep your new smile healthy.

Have you become ashamed of your smile? You’re not alone. Many people become dissatisfied with the appearance of their smile, whether it’s due to misaligned, cracked, chipped, or yellowing teeth. These cosmetic problems can eventually lead to other problems such as gum infection and disease, jaw pain, and difficulty eating.
Cosmetic dentistry
can help to correct these problems, restore the health of your mouth, and give you back a beautiful smile. Once concerned primarily with the aesthetics of your teeth, cosmetic dentistry procedures now address oral health and your overall well-being.

Your personal dental history
When you’re considering cosmetic dental solutions, it’s important to consider you whole mouth, not just the problem area(s). We’ll do a comprehensive exam which will include making an accounting of all your teeth and any restorations that are already in place. A complete cavity check will be done on each tooth as well as an
oral cancer screening
. We will check the gums for any evidence of periodontal disease.
Digital x-rays and photographs of your teeth are necessary to accurately assess the issues, and photographs of your face will be taken in order to match your new and improved smile to your existing facial features.
Then, it’s time to discuss your goals and possible treatment options. In order to restore chipped, crooked, and discolored teeth, we place veneers to even out shape and spacing. We use only the finest quality of ceramic porcelain veneers and crowns in order to give you a natural looking smile.
Cracked and weakened teeth can leading to the formation of cavities. At Exquisite Dentistry, we will design comfortable and naturally looking dental crowns and veneers to repair damaged teeth.
We also provide laser teeth whitening to brighten your teeth up to eight shades in one visit!
