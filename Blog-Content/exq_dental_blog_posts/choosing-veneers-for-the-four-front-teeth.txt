Title: Choosing Veneers for the Four Front Teeth

Your four front teeth are the stars of your smile. If they are chipped, uneven, or different shades, porcelain veneers can give them a bright, balanced look. Veneers are thin shells that cover the front of each tooth, creating a smooth surface and a consistent color.

We may recommend treating four teeth when the rest of your smile already blends well or when you only need to fix a few specific concerns. If several teeth show when you grin, we might talk about adding veneers to the neighboring teeth for the most seamless result.

During your consultation we discuss your goals, assess how your teeth come together, and choose the right shapes and shades. We then take digital scans and photos so the dental lab can craft veneers that suit your features.

At the preparation visit we gently shape the teeth and place temporary covers. This lets you preview the look and feel while the final porcelain pieces are made. Once they arrive, we bond them in place, polish the edges, and make sure your bite feels natural.

High-quality veneers should look like they have always belonged to you. That is why we use premium materials and partner with experienced ceramic artists. Ready to learn if four front veneers are right for you? Schedule a consultation and we will guide you through every step.
