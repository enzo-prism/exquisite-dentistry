# Dental Veneers vs Crowns

## Overview

For effective treatment to restore the shape and color of your teeth, you have a choice in the form of dental veneers or crowns. Both options provide relief in the way of creating a bright, healthy smile – but each goes about solving our dental problems in very different ways.

## Veneers – Improving on a Good Foundation

Good for addressing minor damage, discoloration, or even addressing small adjustments to a person’s teeth for a natural bite alignment, veneers are a popular cosmetic treatment. At Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles, we offer porcelain dental veneers that can be sized and bonded in as few as three visits. Porcelain is a tough material that is naturally resistant to stains (although you must continue to brush and floss and go in for dental cleanings). Porcelain veneers are hand-crafted and sculpted to fit on top and around the biting edge of your teeth, filling in small chips or fixing any oddly-shaped teeth with a bright, clean shell on the top of your existing teeth.

## Crowns – Fixing the Bigger Issues

For those of us who have larger issues that require restorative dental work, Exquisite Dentistry offers restorative services like bridges, implants, and crowns. Dental crowns are used when the tooth or teeth need a much bolder solution than a simple covering like a veneer can solve. Sometimes called “caps,” a crown covers up to the entire surface area of the tooth, effectively replacing the entire exterior of the tooth to protect the core and nerve canal. Like veneers, the crowns used at Exquisite Dentistry are created with porcelain due to its durability, transparency, and natural ability to fight off stains. The process for sculpting a porcelain crown is a longer process, as the tooth (or teeth) in question have to have impressions done (to create the porcelain caps) and those sent out for the construction of the crown. The process for creating a crown usually takes approximately two weeks. Meanwhile, the teeth that will receive your new crown will be prepped – meaning the outer surface of the tooth is shaved down to the correct level for the crown to fit on top. While you are waiting for your porcelain crown to be sculpted and sent back to you, Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team will fit you with a temporary crown to protect your prepped tooth or teeth. When the crown is ready to be permanently placed on the prepped tooth, another visit to Exquisite Dentistry will have it bonded and you will be ready to start enjoying your new smile.

## Choosing Your Best Option

Scheduling an appointment with Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry is the first step towards determining which option is best for you. A key factor in deciding crowns or veneers will depend on the work you want to be done and the level of damage to the teeth you want to get worked on. If the teeth have only minor chips, damages, or discoloration, then it’s likely that a porcelain veneer will be the choice that Dr. Aguil suggests for you. Alternatively, if the teeth you want to correct are seriously damaged, it’s likely that a porcelain crown will be the recommendation. Crowns are designed to be a much more substantial solution and intended to be used when no other restorative option can handle the level of repair that needs to be done. Both processes will require multiple visits to the dentist office, but after discussing your options and the steps necessary to achieve your desired smile, the time and visits will pay off with that gorgeous smile that you’ve always wanted.

## The Cost of Veneers vs Crowns

Comparing the financial side of getting veneers or crowns is not an apples-to-apples decision. Veneers are usually the cheaper option – but that’s because they are considered a strictly cosmetic option and don’t require the same levels of prep or porcelain material. On the flip side, porcelain crowns are viewed as a reconstructive solution to a medical problem and can even be covered by insurance companies. Veneers are often used for improving smiles through small adjustments to issues like gaps in your teeth or possibly correctly a slightly out of alignment bite. Because they’re often seen as an elective cosmetic treatment, most insurance companies will not cover them. When you are looking to having a better smile and a healthier mouth, making a choice based on the cost is not the correct path. Meeting with Dr. Aguil and discussing what you want to accomplish and then going through an appointment where he does a thorough assessment will be the best way to come up with a plan for fixing or reconstructing your desired smile. This may mean a combination of veneers and crowns instead of one of the other, or it could even mean a process involving cleanings, Invisalign treatment (to move your teeth into the desired places), and then finally having your crowns or veneers professionally attached to your teeth.
