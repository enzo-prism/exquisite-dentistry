Title: Dental Veneers vs Crowns

Veneers and crowns are both made from beautiful, tooth-colored materials, but they serve different purposes. Knowing the difference helps you protect your teeth and choose the right treatment.

Veneers cover only the front side of a tooth. We recommend them when the tooth is healthy but needs cosmetic improvements—like fixing worn edges, stubborn discoloration, or small gaps. A veneer leaves most of your tooth structure in place and refreshes the outer appearance.

A crown wraps around the entire tooth. It is the best choice when a tooth is cracked, heavily filled, or has been treated with a root canal. The crown adds strength and shields the tooth from further damage, all while matching your smile.

Both treatments usually take two or three visits. We begin with a consultation and digital scans, then prepare the tooth and place a temporary restoration. Once the final porcelain returns from the lab, we bond it in place and adjust your bite so everything feels comfortable.

Insurance often helps with crowns because they restore function. Veneers are generally considered cosmetic and may not be covered. We will review your benefits and outline costs before treatment begins.

Sometimes a smile makeover includes both veneers and crowns, especially when some teeth need repair and others just need a cosmetic boost. During your visit we will map out every option so you can move forward with confidence.
