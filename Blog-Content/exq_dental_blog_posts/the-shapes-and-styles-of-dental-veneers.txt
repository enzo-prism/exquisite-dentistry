Title: The Shapes and Styles of Dental Veneers

Porcelain veneers can be crafted in many shapes to complement your face and personality. During your consultation we review options ranging from soft, rounded contours to bold, square edges. Together we consider your lip line, facial structure, and the impression you want your smile to make.

Common styles include:
• Softened or oval veneers for a gentle, youthful appearance.
• Enhanced or Hollywood shapes for a bright, symmetrical look.
• Functional or natural designs that mirror the features of healthy enamel.
• Dominant or aggressive styles with defined angles for a confident, striking smile.

We take digital scans and photographs, then preview each shape so you can see how it frames your features. You can also choose the level of brightness—from a subtle refresh to a whiter, camera-ready shade.

Ready to design a smile that feels like you? Schedule a visit. We will walk you through every shape, tailor the style to your goals, and guide you from temporary veneers to the final polished set. 

Dental veneers have become a popular way for people in Los Angeles to significantly improve their smile. Veneers are thin structures of porcelain that can be bonded to your teeth to give them a naturally-bright white look, as well as to improve their shape and spacing.

Choosing
Veneer Shapes
: The Background of Veneers
So, what are
dental veneers
? They’re thin, yet durable pieces of FDA-approved, medical-grade materials bonded directly to the teeth. Veneers are able to cover a host of different issues that cause smiles to lose their radiance:
Cosmetic issues:
Veneers have become a go-to
cosmetic dentistry
treatment because of how easily they are able to cover minor cosmetic issues. Although some people choose our
Zoom! Advanced Teeth Whitening system
, we’ve found that many of our patients love how veneers easily bring the shine back to their smile.
Structural issues:
Not only can veneers help make teeth whiter and brighter, but they can also help solve a multitude of structural issues. Teeth that are chipped, cracked, or that have gaps between them can see remarkable results with porcelain veneers.

Choosing Veneer Shapes: Your Treatment Plan
Most patients are surprised at how simple the process of receiving dental veneers can be. How simple? In as little as three visits, your smile will be transformed:
Visit #1
:
During your initial consultation, Dr. Aguil will make a digital impression of your bite using our
advanced technology
. From the 3D images created, he’ll be able to easily show you the best treatment options for your unique situation.
In between the first and second visits, Dr. Aguil will begin to work with one of the best dental laboratories on the West Coast. Using his expertise and guidance, they’ll work together to begin crafting your veneers.
Visit #2:
To begin, Dr. Aguil will buff off a small layer of each tooth, giving the veneer a secure surface for bonding. Then, he’ll carefully affix a temporary veneer to your tooth, which will last until your next appointment.
During this time, you’ll evaluate the
veneer shape
and color. Once you’ve settled on the perfect
veneer style
and fit, your permanent veneers will be readied.
Visit #3:
Your temporary veneers will be removed and your permanent veneers will be bonded to your teeth. You’re all set, and your veneers will last many years with proper care.
As you can see, the process couldn’t be any simpler. However, you may wonder at what point in the process you will choose the shape and style of your veneer.

Choosing Veneer Shapes: Finding the Perfect Fit
During your first appointment, you’ll select both the shape and color of your veneers. As you begin the process, it’s important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. You want to select a style that makes you happy.
Perhaps the most important part of the process for choosing your veneers deals with their shape. You’ll find that there are many different
veneer shapes
, which may be considered part of a few different categories.
Dental Veneer Shape Types:
Aggressive:
A generally square-shaped style.
Dominant:
Similar to Aggressive, yet with differing incisors.
Enhanced:
A more rounded look, which is often a sought-after style for models.
Functional:
Similar to Enhanced. With Functional style, you’ll find the canines are more pointed, making them more functional for eating.
Hollywood:
The name says it all! One of the most highly-prized styles as these veneers give the classic smile so prized in movies and television.
Mature:
An offshoot of Aggressive, but with more pointed canine teeth.
Natural:
A
veneer style
that is similar to Enhanced, but with much more sharply-shaped canines.
Oval
: All of the canine and incisors take on a more rounded look.
Softened:
An even more rounded look than Oval.
Vigorous:
Aggressive-styled teeth with canines that protrude further than average.
Youthful:
This style is a blend of the Vigorous and Oval styles.
