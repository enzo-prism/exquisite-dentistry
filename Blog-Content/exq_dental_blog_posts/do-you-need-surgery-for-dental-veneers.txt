Title: Do You Need Surgery for Dental Veneers?

Veneers change the way your teeth look without the need for oral surgery. The treatment simply involves shaping the front of your teeth and bonding custom porcelain shells in place. You stay awake, and with local numbing the appointments are comfortable.

During your first visit we review your goals and take digital scans so a dental lab can design veneers that fit precisely. Once your plan is ready, we gently smooth a thin layer of enamel so the veneers sit flush. Temporary veneers let you preview the new look while the final porcelain is crafted.

At the last appointment we bond the porcelain permanently, polish the edges, and make sure your bite feels natural. You walk out the same day with a refreshed smile—no stitches or long recovery required.

If you would like to see whether veneers are right for you, schedule a consultation. We will answer every question and create a plan that fits your comfort level and timeline.
