Title: The Cost of Dental Veneers in Los Angeles

Porcelain veneers are an investment in a brighter, more confident smile. In Los Angeles, high-quality veneers typically range from $1,800 to $2,500 per tooth. Many patients choose to treat 8–10 teeth that show when they smile, while others refresh their full arch for complete symmetry. During your consultation we provide a detailed estimate based on your goals, the number of veneers, and any preparatory care needed.

Why do veneers cost more than whitening or bonding? Premium porcelain looks and feels like natural enamel, resists stains, and is handcrafted by expert ceramists. Combined with digital planning and a cosmetic dentist’s artistry, veneers deliver a customized result that lasts a decade or longer with good care.

Insurance often considers veneers elective, but we review every plan to see if any portion—such as restorations on damaged teeth—can be covered. We also offer flexible payment options to make treatment more comfortable.

Stay Away from Budget Veneers
Top-quality porcelain veneers at
Exquisite Dentistry
are made at one of the best dental labs in the United States and fitted by a leading cosmetic dentist. But not every set of veneers is made with the same quality and care. You could go with one of these other options to cut down on the cost of veneers for your teeth, but it’s not recommended.
Discount veneers cut all sorts of corners. They’re often made in China, and not well-customized to fit your mouth. Expect to see that fake plastic look; the color gives them away every time. And forget reliability. High-end porcelain veneers are expected to last a decade or longer, but you’ll need to replace cheap veneers much sooner than you expect.
Save yourself the trouble, the pain, and the potential embarrassment of low-cost veneers on your teeth. Get your
cosmetic dentistry
done right.
How Dental Insurance Factors Into the Cost
Insurance companies try to only pay for what they have to. Veneers may have a fantastic impact on your life and career, but they’re mostly seen as elective procedures in the eyes of insurance companies. It’s unlikely that the cost of dental veneers will be covered by your insurance.
If medically indicated, the partial cost of veneers for some of your teeth may be covered as crown repair or crown replacement. Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry will work with you to make the most of your insurance .
