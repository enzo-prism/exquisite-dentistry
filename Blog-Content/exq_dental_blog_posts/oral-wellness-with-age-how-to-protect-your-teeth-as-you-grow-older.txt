# Oral Wellness with Age: How to Protect Your Teeth as You Grow Older

## Everything You Need to Know About Caring for Your Oral Wellness with Age

Actor Anthony Hopkins once ironically stated, “Getting old ain’t for the faint of heart.” How true that is! But even if the rest of your body isn’t as young as it used to be, your smile doesn’t have to fade. In fact, oral wellness with age gets easier as mature adult teeth and gums can withstand the effects of aging. Of course, it’s not just the cosmetic aspect of a beautiful smile that should concern you. Healthy teeth and gums are intrinsically linked to overall health, confidence, and the ability to enjoy a fulfilling lifestyle.

and his team at Exquisite Dentistry help patients of all ages achieve peak oral health. His patients often ask him for advice on how to keep excellent oral health as a senior. If you’re trying to turn back the clock on your oral health, consider these tips as you strive for a healthier, brighter smile.

## Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body, and Mind

As you age, it’s essential to consider the broader implications of oral health beyond just your teeth. Your dental well-being directly impacts your overall health and quality of life. Neglecting dental appointments can lead to long-term issues that affect your ability to enjoy a varied diet and maintain proper nutrition. Moreover, conditions like gum disease and cavities not only cause discomfort but also pose serious risks to systemic health, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and even cognitive decline. In addition, some discomforts and infections come with gum disease and cavities. We all remember the agonizing pain from a childhood toothache; it doesn’t get any less painful as we age, and periodontal disease can be even worse. Of course, gum disease doesn’t only affect your mouth. Many studies have proven gum infections are contributing factors to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Early research also indicates a connection between the bacterium from chronic gum disease and cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer’s. Of course, surgeons understand the link between gum disease and overall health. This is why a trip to the dentist for an oral care exam is often required for mature adults before major surgery since many surgeons won’t perform a scheduled procedure until they receive a clean bill of health from the patient’s dentist.

## How to Maintain Excellent Oral Health at Home

Investing in an ultrasonic toothbrush can significantly improve your at-home oral care routine by effectively removing bacteria and food particles. Combine this with regular flossing—ideally done once or twice daily—to further reduce the risk of dental problems. Remember to adhere to the 2×2 principle: brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day for optimal results.

### Routine Dental Visits

Dental care is a lifelong habit. Oral wellness with age includes practices like regular teeth cleanings every three to six months to prevent issues and identify and treat problems. Like everything else, early treatment is less invasive, time-consuming, and costly. An annual oral cancer screening is imperative to catching potential issues early on. Like your routine physical or mammogram, this simple screening can detect signs of oral cancer in its earliest stages, when treatment is most effective. Our VELscope Vx is an advanced oral screening device that can catch oral cancer in its earliest stages Regardless of how well we brush and floss at home, areas, especially below the gum line, take a trained hygienist to reach. These hard-to-reach spaces can harbor plaque and tartar buildup, which, if left untreated, can lead to gum disease and other oral health issues. Neglected areas can also contribute to foul breath, affecting oral health, overall confidence, and well-being. A skilled hygienist is vital in performing thorough cleanings, removing stubborn plaque and tartar, and ensuring that your teeth and gums are healthy and free from harmful bacteria. Proper daily dental hygiene and a dental visit every 4-6 months are essential for maintaining oral wellness. Sometimes, no matter how hard we try to take good care of our teeth, problems can arise. The idea is to minimize teeth replacement—having just one or two tooth implants is much better than a full set of dentures.

### Illuminate Your Smile

Teeth bleaching products can also benefit mature adults by enhancing the brightness of their smile and boosting confidence.
