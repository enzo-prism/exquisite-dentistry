Title: Do You Have a Cracked Tooth?

A cracked tooth can cause sharp pain when you bite, sensitivity to hot or cold, or a constant dull ache. Sometimes you may not feel anything at all. Either way, a crack needs attention so it does not spread.

Common causes include biting hard foods, clenching or grinding, or taking a blow to the mouth. Even large temperature swings—like hot coffee followed by ice water—can stress the enamel.

If a crack is caught early, we can often repair it with a bonding material or cover the tooth with a crown. When a crack reaches the nerve, a root canal may be needed to relieve pain and prevent infection. Waiting too long can lead to tooth loss, so it is important to schedule a visit as soon as you notice a problem.

During your appointment we will examine the area, take digital images, and explain the best treatment for your tooth. Our goal is to relieve discomfort quickly and protect your smile for the long term. Call us if you suspect a crack—we are here to help.
