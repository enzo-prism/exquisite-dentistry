# Veneers or Implants: Choosing the Best Path to a Perfect Smile

## Choosing Veneers or Implants for Your Teeth

When it comes to veneers or implants, both options offer a life-changing transformative solution that can significantly enhance your smile, confidence, and overall dental health. Porcelain veneers are thin, durable shells of high-quality porcelain placed over the teeth to effectively mask imperfections such as chips, stains, or gaps. They offer a fast and minimally invasive solution to enhancing the appearance of your smile and provide immediate results with minimal discomfort. Occasionally, veneers are used in conjunction with dental implants to replace missing or badly damaged teeth. Implants are titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone to replace missing teeth. This option offers a permanent solution that looks, feels, and functions just like natural teeth. Implants restore your smile’s appearance, help preserve jawbone integrity, and prevent dental issues associated with tooth loss. When deciding between veneers or implants, factors such as the condition of your teeth, your oral health, and your desired outcome should be considered. At Exquisite Dentistry in LA, cosmetic dentist Dr. Alexie Aguil is highly skilled in porcelain veneers and dental implants, the optimal use of each, and how to effectively use them together. With years of experience and a dedication to providing exceptional care, Dr. Aguil will answer all your questions and guide you through a treatment plan that is ideal for your case and personal goals. What are Dental Veneers? Porcelain veneers can address various issues that often prevent people from feeling confident about their smiles. Veneers offer a long-lasting solution, effectively correcting cracks, chips, and tooth coloration. Moreover, veneers can straighten crooked teeth and fill gaps between teeth for a fully comprehensive transformation. With their natural appearance and durable quality, porcelain veneers enhance the aesthetics of your smile, boost your self-esteem, and allow you to smile confidently. Partnering with one of the finest dental laboratories in the US, Dr. Aguil crafts each veneer out of the highest quality porcelain to create a natural smile. The treatment process typically takes place over several visits:

### Initial Consultation:

Dr. Aguil starts with a complete exam and cleaning. Then, using our advanced iTero 3D Scanner, he takes a comprehensive digital map of your mouth. Together, you discuss options, including the shape and color of your veneers. Our technology will show you what your smile will look like before you start! Similar to a haircut, it can be helpful to bring in a photo of your ideal smile to guide the discussion with a visual reference. Dr. Aguil will work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that aligns with your aesthetic goals.

### Follow-Up Visit:

Before your final veneers are created, Dr. Aguil will place temporary veneers over your teeth, carefully shaping individual teeth to create the best surface to help each veneer hold securely. He’ll then place the temporary veneers on top of the teeth. These temporary veneers are a model of the final veneers. You’ll notice the transformation immediately, but Dr. Aguil wants you to love them 100% and for the long term, which is why he insists on a try-in period. During the try-in period, you will communicate with him about what you like best about the temporary veneers and what you’d like to change—from color and shape to comfort and your speaking ability.

### Final Visit:

During this visit, your temporary veneers are removed, and the custom-made veneers are securely bonded in place. With your new veneers in place, you’re all set to enjoy years of beautiful smiles. Just like that, your smile is transformed. This seamless process is why many patients choose veneers to enhance their smiles and confidence. What are Implants? Dental implants are artificial roots made of titanium that replace the structure of the missing tooth. Dr. Aguil may recommend dental implants to replace teeth and fix issues related to tooth loss or damage. It’s important to note that all dentists can place implants, but since Dr. Aguil does not, he makes sure to partner with highly skilled specialists near our West Hollywood office to perform the procedure. Depending on the case, Dr. Aguil may suggest a different treatment, like a dental bridge, which anchors to the teeth on either side. Dental implants offer a stronger and more permanent solution for tooth loss. Though the results are equally beautiful for veneers and implants, the implant process is quite different and can take a few months to complete:

### Initial Consultation:

Should Dr. Aguil determine that implants are the right course of treatment for you, he will refer you to our long-time specialists, who will perform their own examination.

### Preparation:

The specialists will prepare your mouth by gently cutting back your gums and inserting a custom-made artificial tooth root into your jawbone. After a few months, your gums will completely heal, allowing for osseointegration, where the jawbone fuses to the implant. Similar to the veneer process, Dr. Aguil works closely with the dental laboratory to guide the implant crown creation. The added layer of quality control ensures that the crown fits the shape, color, and size of your natural teeth.

### Implant Placement:

Once your titanium root is in place and healed, you’ll prepare for your final implant restoration. Dr. Aguil will gently remove the healing cap and make the proper measurements to ensure that your replacement fits exactly as it should. Then, your newly crafted crown will be affixed to the implant. When the process is complete, your smile will be happy and healthy once again. While anesthetic is unnecessary, the treatment itself is done with your absolute comfort in mind. Local anesthetic or gentle sedation options are available at your request. Your jaw may be sore for as long as a few months following your implant, which is easily managed with over-the-counter medication.

## How Veneers and Implants Work Together to Create Your Perfect Smile

While veneers are a popular choice for enhancing the appearance of existing teeth, they are not suitable in cases where a tooth is missing. In such instances, dental implants emerge as a viable alternative, offering a durable and aesthetically pleasing solution for tooth replacement. However, it’s crucial to note that the integration of an implant into the jawbone requires a healing period that can span several months, making it a more time-intensive option compared to other treatments like bridges, which can quickly address gaps left by missing teeth. During consultations, patients often inquire about implants, though these discussions typically revolve around concerns such as replacing missing teeth, rectifying issues with damaged teeth, or updating old crowns, rather than as part of a veneer application. This distinction underscores the importance of tailoring treatment recommendations to the specific needs and circumstances of each patient, ensuring that all options are considered in the context of achieving a harmonious and functional veneer smile makeover. If you’re missing a tooth or need to restore dental function, your primary options typically involve a dental implant or a dental bridge. Each option serves a distinct purpose, and Dr. Aguil can determine the most appropriate treatment based on your specific needs and goals.
