# How Oral Health Problems can Affect Your Overall Health

## Overview

Proper oral care is more than just supporting a stunning smile. Your teeth can indicate a variety of health concerns that most don’t even think about. Did you know that neglecting your teeth and gums poses a risk to your oral and overall health? This can potentially cause issues or increase your risk for conditions that you might expect to be unrelated.

## Healthy Teeth, Better Bones

Many of us dread going to the dentist and put off our appointments until tooth decay has already set in. Would you do the same when it comes to visiting your cardiologist for acute chest pain? The answer is most likely “no”. Unfortunately, oral health isn’t always a priority when it should be. People suffer through sensitive, cracked teeth every day without realizing a beautiful smile isn’t all that’s at stake. Teeth with damage or decay are at risk of infection or inflammation, which can affect your jaw and compromise the bone. Osteoporosis is a real threat for patients with weakened bone structures caused by oral health problems. Cracked, injured teeth don’t repair themselves over time, meaning it’s up to you to take the initiative and seek treatment. Good oral and overall health are two forms of preventative care that can also give you beautiful teeth. Knowing your mouth like you know your body and learning how to take care of it is important for maintaining a fulfilling lifestyle and feeling good about it.

## Problems in Your Mouth, Problems Overall

Most of us tend to take the words “heart condition” or “lung disease” more seriously than “periodontal disease,” despite strong evidence that oral health and heart health are interlinked. We take daily measures to prevent heart and lung disease from impacting our quality of life. Why shouldn’t we do the same for our oral health? Our mouths are entry points for the different types of infection and bacteria we encounter every day. Oral health problems can be quick to develop in the teeth and gums where proper care and protection hasn’t been provided. From there, inflammation and bacteria can travel to other parts of the body and turn into a life-threatening problem affecting your oral and overall health. When bacteria from infected teeth or gums enters the bloodstream, the results can be devastating. Poor oral health can cause heart attacks and stroke due to bacterial collecting in the arteries. If bacteria are in the lungs, it can turn into pneumonia. Oral health problems can also help diagnose other unknown issues affecting the rest of the body. Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS can develop sores in their mouths as a side effect of immunodeficiency. Blood diseases and diabetes also impact your teeth and gums by weakening your body’s ability to fight infection, therefore increasing your risk of periodontal disease.

## A Healthy Diet Affects Oral and Overall Health

Healthy eating and drinking also play a role in preventative care when it comes to problems with oral health. Due to the sugar content in most alcoholic beverages, patients who consume alcohol in moderation are less likely to develop periodontal diseases, stained teeth, or blood sugar disorders. Avoiding overindulgence with junk food is good for your teeth and your waistline.

## Minding Your Oral Health

Preventative care and early treatments for oral and overall health problems are far better than waiting and addressing the problem when it might be too late.

### Knowing

the signs for early oral cancer are important, but consulting professionals and having regular oral cancer screenings can help spot what our eyes cannot. If you’re a smoker, quitting is another healthy habit to pick up. Female smokers are at a greater risk of developing oral cancer, which can go on to spread and affect their overall health. But it isn’t just tobacco smokers in danger: people who use marijuana are also more likely to develop severe oral health problems as well. When you brush and floss properly, you’re removing food particles and bacteria that could otherwise build into plaque or tartar. Brushing twice a day for two minutes each can greatly reduce your chances of developing oral health problems. Getting an electric toothbrush and finding time to floss are two easy things you can add to your routine. Check out these 5 tips for improving oral care, even on a workday. Even with daily care, schedule regular teeth cleanings. Consistent visits with dental professionals who can recognize early signs of oral health problems are the most efficient way to stay on top of your overall health.
