# Adjusting to Invisalign While Starting a New Job

## How to Handle Invisalign While Starting a New Job

Starting a new job can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. Add to that the adjustment period of new Invisalign aligners, and you might find yourself juggling a bit more than you anticipated. But fear not—this blog is here to help you manage Invisalign while starting a new job, ensuring you feel confident and comfortable every step of the way.

### Why Timing Matters

Timing is key when it comes to both major life changes and orthodontic treatments. Starting a new job is a significant step, and adding Invisalign treatment to the mix might seem daunting. However, with a bit of planning and awareness, you can seamlessly incorporate both into your routine. Understanding the timing of your Invisalign treatment can alleviate much of the stress associated with transitioning into a new job. If possible, start your treatment a few weeks before your new job begins. This allows you to get accustomed to your aligners at home before facing the added pressure of a new work environment.

### Managing Discomfort

Adjusting to Invisalign aligners involves managing some initial discomfort. This can be particularly challenging when you’re also adapting to a new job. Keep pain relief options handy, such as over-the-counter pain relievers or orthodontic wax, to ease any irritation caused by the aligners. Ensure you stay hydrated and avoid foods that might exacerbate discomfort. Soft foods like yogurt, soups, and smoothies can be your best friends during this period. Staying mindful of your diet can make the adjustment process much smoother.

### Developing a Routine

Establishing a routine is essential for successfully managing Invisalign while starting a new job. Set reminders on your phone to ensure you wear your aligners for the recommended 20-22 hours per day. Consistency is key to achieving the desired results. Incorporate your aligner care into your daily schedule. Make it a habit to clean your aligners while brushing your teeth in the morning and before bed. This routine will soon become second nature, making the process much more manageable.
