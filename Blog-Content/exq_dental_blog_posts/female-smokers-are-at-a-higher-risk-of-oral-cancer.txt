Title: Female Smokers Are at a Higher Risk of Oral Cancer

Women who smoke face a higher risk of developing oral cancer. Tobacco irritates the delicate tissues in your mouth, and over time those cells can change in ways that lead to cancer. HPV infections and heavy alcohol use can add to the risk, especially when smoking is involved.

Early warning signs include sores that do not heal, red or white patches, persistent sore throat, or pain when swallowing. Many people do not notice any symptoms, which is why regular screenings at your dental visits are so important.

The best protection is to quit smoking. If you are ready to stop, we can connect you with resources and support programs. Brushing gently, eating a balanced diet, and limiting alcohol also help keep your mouth healthy.
