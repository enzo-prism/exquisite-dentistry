Advanced Cosmetic Dentist for Adults in Los Angeles: What to Expect
Nowadays, pediatric dentists are decked out with all sorts of amenities to make children feel comfortable and at ease during their dental visits. But have you ever wondered why the same level of care and comfort isn’t readily available when it comes to visiting a cosmetic dentist for adults?

What if your dental appointment left you feeling the way you do after visiting a spa: calm, confident, and glowing?
That’s what we do at
Exquisite Dentistry
in Los Angeles. Step into our spa-like office designed with adult comfort in mind and experience a whole new level of dental care—one that genuinely prioritizes relaxation and your overall well-being. Our unique approach considers every aspect of your dental experience, from making an appointment to treatment to checkout and follow-up.
Routine Dental Visits as Part of a Healthy Lifestyle
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle encompasses more than just diet and exercise. The condition of your mouth plays a significant role in your body’s ability to function. Beyond the aesthetics of a bright smile, the health of your teeth and gums can have profound implications for your entire body.
Research
has shown that gum disease, caused by bacteria in the mouth, can contribute to the development of heart disease and increase the risk of stroke. As we become adults, the inflammation and infection associated with gum disease can also exacerbate existing heart conditions such as diabetes, HIV, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer’s.
Just as you visit the doctor for an annual checkup, even while getting adequate exercise and eating a balanced diet, so too should you visit the dentist for regular
cleanings
, even with proper oral hygiene habits. Each time you eat, you introduce bacteria into your mouth, which leads to plaque buildup on teeth. If not properly removed, plaque can contribute to gum disease and tooth decay. While brushing and flossing are effective at removing plaque from the surfaces of the teeth and between them, they may not eliminate all plaque.
Over time, this plaque hardens into tartar (or dental calculus), which cannot be removed by brushing and flossing alone. Professional dental tools, such as scalers and ultrasonic devices, are necessary to effectively remove tartar during a dental cleaning. That’s why regular dental cleanings are crucial for maintaining oral health and preventing gum disease in adults.
Furthermore, the alignment of your mouth also affects your overall health.
Studies
show that proper dental alignment can help prevent issues such as orofacial pain and temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ). Good alignment also promotes optimal oral hygiene by facilitating effective brushing and flossing and reducing the risk of plaque accumulation and gum disease. And don’t forget the power of proper teeth alignment to enhance confidence in social interactions and overall self-esteem. For adults, treatments like
porcelain veneers
and
Invisalign
are great options to straighten teeth, correct your bite, and improve your oral health.
