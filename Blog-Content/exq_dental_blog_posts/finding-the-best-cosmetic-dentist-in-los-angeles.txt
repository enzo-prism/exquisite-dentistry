# Finding the Best Cosmetic Dentist in Los Angeles

## Overview

There are thousands of cosmetic dentists in Los Angeles. So how do you find the best for a Hollywood Smile Design? They would certainly have to provide an exceptionally comfortable and painless experience, employ leading technology, and a world-class team.

## Dr. Alexie Aguil

, a leading cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, best describes what you should look for in the search for your ideal dentist.

### Consider the Environment

Many dentist offices stick to the medical essentials when it comes to the atmosphere, and there is nothing wrong with that. However, we believe the bright lights, loud noises, and general awkwardness don’t make for a visit you’ll look forward to. That means the best cosmetic dentists in Los Angeles would have to have a different kind of atmosphere. Dr. Aguil was a pioneer in creating the “dental spa” environment. These types of offices go above and beyond to make your experience stress-free. Exquisite Dentistry in Beverly Hills may be the best. Visitors can expect to be treated to pleasant decor and aromas, tucked under a warm blanket, and fitted with plush noise cancelling headphones they can use to enjoy music or Netflix.

### Consider the Team

A great cosmetic dentist may be able to provide a complete smile makeover in as few as 3 trips. Other procedures, such as Invisalign treatment, may be completed in as little as 6 months. In any case, a cosmetic dentist and team who will work to build a good rapport with you are an important aspect of the experience. The best cosmetic dentists in Los Angeles will have a skilled and compassionate team that will put your needs first every single time you visit.
