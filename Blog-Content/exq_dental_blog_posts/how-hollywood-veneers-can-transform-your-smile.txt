If you’re thinking the best veneers in Hollywood are for patients with stained, discolored teeth, you’re absolutely correct. But there are several other excellent reasons to choose porcelain veneers: Your enamel is thin. In cases like this, you may be experiencing sensitivities to hot and cold. Your teeth may even look translucent. In these cases, a veneer will act as a protective shield to your teeth. Your teeth are chipped or cracked. Dental crowns are often used in situations where teeth are severely cracked, but occasionally that solution is not the best choice. For less extensive damage, dental veneers may be the perfect option. They’ll smooth out the surface of the tooth and make it look as good as new. Your teeth have gaps between them. In certain cases, using veneers to fill the gaps between teeth is a quicker and easier choice that undergoing orthodontic work. Where Do I Get Hollywood Veneers?
