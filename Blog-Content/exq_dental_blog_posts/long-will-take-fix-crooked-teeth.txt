# How Long Does It Take to Fix Crooked Teeth in Adults?

## Overview

Teeth straightening is becoming one of the most popular and sought-after cosmetic dentistry treatments. Traditionally, getting braces has been thought of as a straightening treatment for tweens and teenagers, but more and more adults these days are interested in improving their smiles. Whether for cosmetic reasons, improved dental health, or a combination of both, having a straighter smile can not only improve your self-confidence but can also help to prevent or treat issues such as gum disease, TMJ, and tooth decay. The question then becomes how long does it take to fix crooked teeth in adults? Treatment with traditional metal braces can take up to two years. If you’re looking for a quicker fix for that perfect selfie at an upcoming wedding or you’re thinking about those graduation pictures at the end of your senior year, you’ll want to consider some of the newer options for correcting crooked teeth. Clear aligners such as Invisalign are among the best ways of how to fix crooked teeth in adults. They can help move teeth quickly and are becoming one of the most popular options for straightening teeth. However, not everyone is a candidate for this type of orthodontia. Well—How Crooked Are They? If you ask your dentist the question of how long it will take to straighten your teeth, he or she will tell you that it depends on the severity of the problems. In cases involving severely crooked teeth, large gaps, and alignment problems, the more traditional metal braces are most likely the best option. Additionally, if there are issues with your back teeth or if there is a need to rotate teeth or move them vertically, metal braces may also be the better choice for you. Invisalign is a great treatment option for adults wondering how to fix crooked teeth. Patients with more common issues such as overbites, underbites, crossbites, crowded or gapped teeth are the best candidates for Invisalign. The clear aligners are comfortable to wear, easy to use, and are very effective for straightening teeth and improving your smile without the pain and discomfort of traditional metal braces.

### The Invisalign Difference

The difference between Invisalign and traditional braces is clear... no pun intended! Patients love the cosmetic benefits that Invisalign offers. Where traditional braces fill your mouth with metal brackets and wires, Invisalign trays are made of clear, hard plastic. Because they’re transparent, they’re almost invisible to the eye. Most people won’t even know you’re wearing them. Compare that to how adults fix crooked teeth with metal braces! Invisalign aligner trays are removable which makes for easier cleaning and overall maintenance. Because they can be taken in and out. They also allow you to eat whatever food you want. Of course, this is different from traditional metal braces, which are hard to brush and floss and have restrictions on what types of food you can eat. You won’t be able to chew gum, eat popcorn, hard candy, or a host of other foods and drinks. This isn’t the case with Invisalign, with which nothing is restricted. Most patients also report that they feel considerably less pain with Invisalign as well. Any time teeth shift in the mouth, there is a level of discomfort. However, Invisalign patients can expect to deal with much less gum irritation and tenderness that they would from wearing metal braces. For all these reasons, you can see how Invisalign is the superior way to fix crooked teeth in adults.
