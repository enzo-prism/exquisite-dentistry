    question: "What is a smile makeover?",
    answer:
      "A smile makeover is a personalized treatment plan that can combine whitening, bonding, porcelain veneers, Invisalign, and restorative dentistry to improve tooth color, shape, and symmetry. The right plan depends on your goals, enamel health, existing dental work, and bite."
  },
  {
    question: "What treatments are included in a smile makeover?",
    answer:
      "Common options include professional whitening, dental bonding, porcelain veneers, Invisalign, crowns, and dental implants. Some patients need only one or two treatments, while others benefit from a staged plan for predictable shade matching and bite stability."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a smile makeover take?",
    answer:
      "Some makeovers can be completed quickly (for example, whitening or bonding). Veneers typically take a few visits, while Invisalign-based plans can take several months. After your consultation and scans, we’ll outline a realistic timeline and sequence."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a smile makeover cost in Los Angeles?",
    answer:
      "Costs vary widely based on the treatments involved, the number of teeth in the smile zone, and whether alignment or restorative care is needed. We provide an itemized plan with options so you can prioritize the changes that matter most to you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Invisalign before veneers or bonding?",
    answer:
      "Not always. If crowding, spacing, or bite issues affect your result, Invisalign first can improve proportions and make cosmetic finishing more conservative. We’ll recommend the sequence that delivers the most natural-looking result for your smile and bite."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a smile makeover be done without veneers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many patients get a refreshed, natural-looking smile with whitening, bonding, enamel recontouring, or Invisalign. Veneers are helpful when you want bigger changes to shape, symmetry, or shade that whitening alone can’t deliver."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my smile makeover look natural?",
    answer:
      "Natural results are the goal. We plan shade, tooth shape, texture, and smile arc around your facial features and lip dynamics, and we coordinate treatments so porcelain and natural enamel match as closely as possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a smile makeover painful?",
    answer:
      "Most patients are comfortable during cosmetic treatment. We use gentle techniques and can discuss comfort options based on your sensitivity history and the procedures in your plan."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do smile makeover results last?",
    answer:
      "Longevity depends on the treatments involved and your habits. Whitening may require periodic touch-ups, while veneers and restorative work can last many years with proper hygiene, regular checkups, and protection if you grind or clench."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you plan a smile makeover before an event?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you have a deadline (wedding, graduation, photos, travel), we can recommend a timeline that fits, often starting with whitening and short-term improvements, then layering longer-term changes when appropriate."
