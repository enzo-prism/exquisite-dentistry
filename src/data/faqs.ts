      "What Types of Imaging (X-Rays, CT Scan) are available at Exquisite Dentistry?",
    answer:
      "We use digital imaging for routine x-rays and 3D imaging for more advanced diagnosis. Our iTero scanner takes a digital impression of your mouth and records the movement of teeth over time, something that happens to everyone as we age.\n\niTero scanning also allows us to create digital impressions for crowns and bridges. This is great news for our patients because in many cases, we won't have to use traditional trays lined with a gooey material to create these impressions. This is another way our advanced technology helps to make your visit more comfortable."
