    question: "Am I a candidate for dental implants?",
    answer:
      "Many healthy adults are candidates for implants, but the best plan depends on bone support, gum health, bite forces, and medical history. During your Los Angeles consultation, we review medications, habits (like smoking or clenching), and any existing dental work to confirm the safest path.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the implant process take?",
    answer:
      "Many single-tooth cases take several months from planning to the final crown, while multi-tooth and full-arch plans can take longer. Healing time varies based on bone health and whether grafting is recommended. After imaging, we’ll outline a realistic timeline for your case.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is recovery like?",
    answer:
      "Most patients describe recovery as manageable. You may have temporary soreness or swelling, and we’ll give clear post-op guidance on diet, activity, and hygiene. If you have a busy schedule, we’ll coordinate appointments to reduce disruption while healing progresses.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a bone graft or sinus lift?",
    answer:
      "Not always. If bone volume is limited, grafting or sinus lift procedures can help create a stable foundation for implants. We’ll explain what we see on your CBCT scan and whether foundation work improves predictability and long-term stability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can implants replace multiple missing teeth?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Options include implant-supported bridges for several missing teeth and full-arch solutions when many teeth are missing. We’ll review which approach fits your bite, esthetic goals, and maintenance preferences.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do implants look natural?",
    answer:
      "A well-planned implant restoration is designed to match nearby teeth in color, shape, and gum contours. We use restoration-first planning so the final result guides placement decisions and bite refinement.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do dental implants last?",
    answer:
      "Implants are designed for long-term function, but longevity depends on home care, professional maintenance, bite forces, and overall health. We’ll recommend cleaning tools and recall intervals to protect your investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you place a temporary tooth right away?",
    answer:
      "In some cases, a temporary tooth or provisional restoration can be used during healing, especially for front-tooth esthetics. Final restorations are typically delivered after the implant integrates and tissues are stable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does insurance cover dental implants?",
    answer:
      "Coverage varies by plan. If you have dental insurance, we can help document the procedure and submit information to support any applicable implant benefits.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I choose an implant or a bridge?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the number of missing teeth, the health of adjacent teeth, bone support, budget, and timeline. We’ll compare implants and bridges in the context of your goals so you can choose the most predictable option.",
