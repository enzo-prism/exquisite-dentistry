  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Keeping your mouth healthy does not have to feel overwhelming. Small choices add up, and your teeth respond quickly when you give them consistent care. These five habits are simple to follow and make a big difference for your smile and gums.</p>\n        <p>Brush with a gentle touch. Hold your toothbrush at an angle toward the gums and guide it in slow circles across every surface. Two minutes, twice a day, is the sweet spot. If your hand gets tired, an electric brush can help you clean thoroughly without pressing too hard.</p>\n        <p>Floss once a day to clear away the sticky film that hides between teeth. Slide the floss along the side of each tooth with a light “C” shape. If traditional floss is tricky for you, try floss picks or a water flosser—anything that keeps the spaces between your teeth fresh.</p>\n        <p>Rinse with water after snacks and meals. A quick swish removes lingering sugar and acid before they irritate your enamel. When you have access to a sink, brush afterward. If not, reach for sugar-free gum to trigger saliva, which naturally washes and protects your teeth.</p>\n        <p>Choose smart snacks. Crunchy fruits and vegetables scrub your teeth while you chew. Cheese, nuts, and yogurt offer calcium that keeps enamel strong. Save sweets and sticky treats for special moments, and pair them with water so the sugars do not sit on your teeth for long.</p>\n        <p>Stay on schedule with checkups. Professional cleanings remove hardened buildup that home tools cannot reach. Twice-yearly visits also give us a chance to spot small concerns—like tiny cracks or early gum irritation—before they become painful or expensive problems.</p>\n        <p>Protect your smile from tobacco and vaping. Smoke and vape aerosols dry the mouth, stain enamel, and raise the risk of gum disease and oral cancer. Your teeth and body stay healthier when you avoid these products.</p>\n        <p>Healthy habits are easier when you have support. Our team loves celebrating progress, answering questions, and helping you tailor your routine to your lifestyle. If you ever feel unsure about a tool or technique, reach out. We are here to keep your smile bright, comfortable, and confident every day.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Losing a tooth can make eating, speaking, and smiling feel awkward. Dental implants give you a strong, natural-looking tooth replacement that feels like it belongs in your mouth. Here are five clear reasons our patients love this option.</p>\n        <h3>1. Looks and feels like the real thing. An implant is anchored into the jawbone, so your new tooth does not wobble or slip. The crown is custom shaded to match your smile, which keeps conversations, photos, and everyday moments worry-free.</h3>\n        <h3>2. Built to last. With regular brushing, flossing, and checkups, implants can last for decades. You avoid the frequent repairs or replacements that often come with bridges or removable dentures.</h3>\n        <h3>3. Protects your jawbone. When a tooth is missing, the bone underneath can shrink. The implant post acts like a new tooth root, giving your bone the gentle pressure it needs to stay strong and healthy.</h3>\n        <h3>4. Easy to care for. You brush and floss an implant just like your natural teeth—no soaking cups, sticky pastes, or extra steps. Because the implant stays put, you can bite into apples, enjoy a steak, and speak clearly without second-guessing your smile.</h3>\n        <h3>5. Confidence from ear to ear. A gap-free smile helps you feel comfortable at work, out with friends, and during close conversations. Many patients tell us they immediately feel more like themselves after their implant heals.</h3>\n        <p>Not sure if an implant is right for you? We will look at your full health history, budget, and goals. Together we can walk through other choices, such as bridges or partial dentures, and determine the path that fits you best.</p>\n        <p>When you are ready, our team guides you through every step—from planning and surgery to the final crown—so you always know what to expect. Schedule a consultation to talk through your options and discover how a dental implant can restore your smile for the long term.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Busy schedules can make it tough to give your teeth attention during the workday. A few small habits can keep your mouth feeling fresh, even when meetings and deadlines stack up. Here are five easy ways to care for your smile while you are on the job.</p>\n        <h3>1. Pick a predictable time. Choose a moment that already fits into your daily rhythm—after lunch, after your afternoon latte, or before you head home. Set a phone reminder so you do not forget. Once it becomes part of your routine, that quick cleaning feels effortless.</h3>\n        <h3>2. Build a compact care kit. Keep a travel toothbrush, small toothpaste, floss or floss picks, and sugar-free gum in a zipper pouch or desk drawer. When everything is ready to go, you can freshen up quickly and discreetly wherever you work.</h3>\n        <h3>3. Rinse when you cannot brush. If the sink is busy or you are in the car between appointments, swish water around your mouth for thirty seconds. This simple step clears away food particles and lessens stains until you can brush properly.</h3>\n        <h3>4. Be mindful of shared spaces. Use the restroom rather than the break room sink, toss used floss into the trash, and wipe the counter when you finish. A little courtesy keeps coworkers comfortable and makes it easier to stick with your new habit.</h3>\n        <h3>5. Stay consistent. The more you repeat these steps, the more natural they feel. Give yourself credit for protecting your health and confidence, even on hectic days.</h3>\n        <p>Strong workplace habits support the care you receive at your dental visits. If it has been a while since your last cleaning, schedule one—we will polish away buildup, check for early concerns, and help you fine-tune the tools that work best for you.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Oral cancer is easier to treat when we find it early. That is why regular dental visits include a simple screening. Between checkups, keep an eye out for these six warning signs and contact us if anything feels off.</p>\n        <h3>1. A sore or lump that will not heal. Look for rough spots on your tongue, cheeks, lips, or the floor of your mouth. If a place stays tender, thick, or raised for more than two weeks, let us examine it.</h3>\n        <h3>2. Red, white, or speckled patches. Color changes in your mouth are often harmless, but new velvety patches need a professional look—especially if they peel, bleed, or sting.</h3>\n        <h3>3. Numbness or tingling. A sudden loss of feeling in your lips, chin, or inside the mouth can signal that something deeper is happening.</h3>\n        <h3>4. Persistent throat irritation. A scratchy throat, hoarse voice, or the feeling that something is stuck when you swallow deserve attention if they do not clear up soon.</h3>\n        <h3>5. Jaw or ear discomfort. Trouble chewing, opening wide, or ringing pain in one ear without hearing loss may be related to changes in your oral tissues.</h3>\n        <h3>6. A tooth that loosens unexpectedly. Teeth should not wiggle once they are fully grown. If one starts to shift without injury, schedule a visit.</h3>\n        <p>These symptoms do not always mean cancer, but they do need a professional evaluation. During your appointment we use advanced light technology to spot concerns that the eye cannot see, giving you peace of mind. Call us if you notice any of these signs or if it has been a year since your last screening.</p>\n      </div>",

Two of the most common options are dental bonding and porcelain veneers. Both use tooth-colored materials, but they differ in how they are applied and how long they last.</p>\n        <p>Bonding is the quicker solution. We place a moldable resin on your tooth, gently shape it, and harden it with a curing light. Bonding works well when you need a small repair—closing a tiny gap, covering a chip, or touching up a single discolored spot. It rarely requires numbing and can usually be finished in a single visit.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>A high-end dental office combines advanced care with thoughtful comfort. Look for a practice that invests in modern tools—digital scanners, low-radiation imaging, laser whitening—so treatments are efficient and precise. Ask how they keep you informed during procedures and what options they offer for managing anxiety or sensitivity.</p>\n        <p>Atmosphere matters, too. Calming lighting, cozy blankets, quiet technology, and entertainment options help visits feel more like a spa than a clinic. When you feel relaxed, it is easier to ask questions and stay consistent with your care.</p>\n        <p>Finally, pay attention to the team. From the dentist to the front desk, you should feel listened to and supported. A caring, experienced staff can tailor everything from cleanings to smile makeovers around your needs. If you are searching in Los Angeles, visit our West Hollywood office to experience what high-end dentistry can feel like.</p>\n        <p>Do you smile with your lips closed or your hand in front of your mouth? Do you hate taking pictures because you don’t want anyone to see your teeth? Maybe you feel like your career has been held back because your smile isn’t everything it could be? If this is how you feel, you’re not alone.</p>\n        <p>Being unhappy with your teeth can really take a bite out of your confidence. The good news is that Exquisite Dentistry can help. We understand that having a set of straight, white teeth can make all the difference in the world. We’ve helped thousands of patients get the smile they deserve , and we’re confident we can help you too.</p>\n        <p>Perhaps you’ve known for a while that you need to visit the dentist, but the process of going to the dentist gives you anxiety. You’re not the only one! That’s why high-end dental offices exist, to provide high-end dentistry in a soothing, comforting environment. If you’re looking to find a dentist like this, Exquisite Dentistry can help. We’ve worked hard to create an office that our patients love, and we’re happy to share with you what makes a high-end dental office so unique.</p>\n        <h2>High-End Dental Offices Have the Best Technology</h2>\n        <p>If you need some help developing a smile you can be proud of, you’ll want to consider cosmetic dentistry . In the past, this meant that you’d have to put up with a mouth full of metal for two years. However, high-end dentistry offers newer, more effective solutions. Today’s cosmetic dentistry offers many innovative ways to improve your teeth’s appearance, from laser teeth-whitening to veneers .</p>\n        <p>At Exquisite Dentistry, we have the latest in laser teeth whitening technology. Our Zoom! Advanced teeth whitening system can provide you teeth that are eight shades whiter in about an hour. No bleach. No messy trays. No need for multiple visits to the dentist.</p>\n        <p>We also utilize cutting-edge technology such as the 3D Orthophos SL Cone Beam, which assists in high-quality dental implants, and the VELscope Vx, which catches oral cancer at its very earliest stages. You’ll especially love our iTero Scanner, which can show you the final results of your intended treatment in just minutes.</p>\n        <h2>High-End Dental Offices Have the Best Atmosphere</h2>\n        <p>We’ve all experienced the traditional dentist office. The lobby filled with year-old magazines you have no interest in reading. The bright lights shined in your eyes while you’re tipped back in a hard, vinyl-covered chair. The loud buzzing of dental equipment. It seems like the entire experience seems to be designed to make you uneasy from the moment your walk through the front door.</p>\n        <p>Instead, wouldn’t it be better to visit a dentist office where you can actually relax? Imagine an environment that was created to ease the frayed nerves of dental patients. It would be the kind of place that more resembled a spa than a dentist’s office. The lighting would be soft, the décor would be tasteful, and the air would smell of peaceful essential oils. You’d sit in a comfortable chair with a warm blanket. Instead of listening to the sound of a drill, you could listen to your favorite music with noise cancelling headphones. If only you could find such a place!</p>\n        <p>The good news is that such a place already exists: Exquisite Dentistry. Our dental spa atmosphere will surprise you. But, once you experience our unique, relaxing office once, you’ll never want to go back to a traditional dentist’s office again!</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>High-End Dental Offices Have the Best Team</h2>\n        <p>Of course, all of these wonderful tools and amenities are of little value if the office’s dentists and team are not caring and compassionate. You need to have a dentist who will carefully listen to your concerns and will help you feel confident that your needs are being put first.</p>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n        <p>and his team at his team have been providing high-end dentistry to their patients since 2006. At the time, Dr. Aguil recognized the glaring problem in dentistry: the lack of high-end dental offices that can provide a next-level experience. He set about fixing this issue when he opened his office. He put his years of experience in patient care into creating a holistic practice that treats the entire person. Your comfort is his main concern. Dr. Aguil was a pioneer in the area of dental spas, and his office remains a leader in this type of care.</p>\n        <h2>Your High-End Dental Office Is Close By</h2>\n        <p>We all know that taking care of oral health is critical to overall health, but many of us avoid the dentist because of a negative past experience. Unfortunately, keeping away from the dentist may not seem like a problem in the short-term, but over time your issues will compound.</p>\n        <p>If you’re needing to find a dentist, a simple Google search will turn up a list of doctors near your location. Finding a dentist is easy. Finding a dentist you can trust, that’s not so simple! How do you sort through all of the reviews?

Without enough saliva, bacteria thrive and enamel slowly weakens, which can lead to cavities, staining, or sensitivity.</p>\n        <p>To protect your smile, sip water between drinks and choose mixers that are low in sugar. Sparkling water with citrus or herbs is a refreshing option. If you enjoy red wine or dark cocktails, rinse your mouth with water afterward to wash away pigments that might settle on your enamel.</p>\n        <p>Avoid chewing on ice and wait at least 30 minutes before brushing so softened enamel has time to re-harden. Regular cleanings and oral cancer screenings help catch any changes early, especially if you drink frequently.</p>\n        <p>Have questions about alcohol and your teeth? Bring them to your next checkup. We are happy to help you create habits that let you enjoy a night out while keeping your smile healthy.</p>\n        <p>A glass of wine with a good meal or an ice-cold beer while you’re watching the game—for some people, these are some of life’s simplest pleasures. Unfortunately, the effect alcohol has on your dental health is not as pleasant.</p>\n        <p>If you drink in moderation, you might not worry much about what those Friday night cocktails or weekend suds are doing to your mouth. Understanding how alcohol affects your teeth is the best way to enjoy the occasional drink—without sacrificing your smile.</p>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil at</h2>\n        <p>Exquisite Dentistry , Los Angeles’ premiere dental spa, recently gave this advice for those who drink alcohol.</p>\n        <h2>Dry vs. Sweet</h2>\n        <p>The high-sugar content in some alcoholic drinks can lead to tooth decay and cavities so that extra vodka and cranberry could be doing more damage than you think. Mixers are often to blame—those dire warnings your dentist makes about sugary sodas and fruit juices still apply when they’re mixed with spirits! Where possible, opt for a sugar-free option like soda water with some fresh mint—just as satisfying, without the toothache.</p>\n        <p>When it comes to wine, there’s a general rule that’s easy to remember—the sweeter the flavor, the more sugar it likely has. Dry wines often have less residual sugar from the fermentation process while maintaining a rich, fruity flavor.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <p>Enamel Staining The occasional drink doesn’t have to cost you your pearly smile—but it will if you don’t take care of your teeth. Red wine contains dark pigments called chromogens that can cause dullness and long-term discoloration. Dark beer and dark soda mixers are also culprits: the acid in the drinks softens the enamel on your teeth, increasing the risk of staining.</p>\n        <p>Drinking through a straw is a good way to minimize teeth staining, though not always practical. If you must sip, rinse your mouth with water between drinks to minimize your enamel’s exposure to the offending liquid—it’ll also help to reduce your hangover the following day by keeping you hydrated! Using a whitening toothpaste before going to bed will also help combat the alcohol’s staining effects.</p>\n        <h2>Other Risk Factors</h2>\n        <p>Another good reason to drink water alongside alcohol is to prevent dehydration. You’ll find your saliva flow decreases after a few alcoholic drinks, meaning your mouth can’t naturally wash away bacteria sticking to your teeth. Chewing sugar-free gum is another option to get the saliva flowing again, and helps keep your breath fresh even after a few beers.</p>\n        <p>Speaking of beer, if you drink it regularly, consider switching to a low-carb brand. The lower acidity and higher water content make it better for your teeth, and your waistline—that’s one way to avoid a beer belly.</p>\n        <p>Finally, if you habitually crunch the ice in your drink, your dentist implores you to stop. Chewing ice can chip and crack your teeth, not to mention worsening your sensitivity and wearing down your enamel. It’s best to leave the ice in the glass.</p>\n        <p>Following these simple tips will help keep alcohol from affecting your teeth, but don’t forget to keep up with your regular dental appointments to spot any issues early. If you are a moderate to heavy drinker, you should also consider undergoing an oral cancer screening due to the direct link between alcohol and dental health.</p>\n        <p>Contact us today for more information, as well as for an in-office consultation.</p>\n      </div>",

They are durable, stain-resistant, and can last a decade or more with regular brushing, flossing, and professional cleanings.</p>\n        <p>Ready to see how veneers could elevate your smile?

That’s what porcelain veneers can do for you. Hollywood-style veneers can correct discolored or misshapen teeth to totally transform your smile.</p>\n        <h2>What are Hollywood Porcelain Veneers?</h2>\n        <p>Veneers are a super-thin layer of porcelain that are gently bonded to the front of your teeth. They can be applied in as few as three dentist visits. When you work with a world-class cosmetic dentist like Exquisite Dentistry , you can expect to come away with a completely natural-looking smile.</p>\n        <p>To consult with a leading cosmetic dentist in West Hollywood, give us a call at (323) 272-2388 or Contact us online for a consultation.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>Who Are Hollywood Veneers For?</h2>\n        <p>If you’re thinking the best veneers in Hollywood are for patients with stained, discolored teeth, you’re absolutely correct. But there are several other excellent reasons to choose porcelain veneers: Your enamel is thin. In cases like this, you may be experiencing sensitivities to hot and cold. Your teeth may even look translucent. In these cases, a veneer will act as a protective shield to your teeth.</p>\n        <p>Your teeth are chipped or cracked.</p>\n        <p>Dental crowns are often used in situations where teeth are severely cracked, but occasionally that solution is not the best choice. For less extensive damage, dental veneers may be the perfect option. They’ll smooth out the surface of the tooth and make it look as good as new.</p>\n        <p>Your teeth have gaps between them. In certain cases, using veneers to fill the gaps between teeth is a quicker and easier choice that undergoing orthodontic work.</p>\n        <h2>Where Do I Get Hollywood Veneers?</h2>\n        <p>The best place to get your Hollywood-style veneers is… Hollywood!

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Your mouth is connected to the rest of your body. When teeth or gums are inflamed, harmful bacteria can enter the bloodstream and strain the heart, lungs, and immune system. Research links gum disease with heart disease, stroke, diabetes complications, and respiratory infections.</p>\n        <p>That is why daily brushing, flossing, and routine cleanings matter. They remove the plaque that causes inflammation before it has a chance to travel. If you notice bleeding gums, persistent bad breath, loose teeth, or sores that do not heal, schedule a dental visit right away—those signs often point to bigger health concerns.</p>\n        <p>Supporting your oral health also means eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and quitting tobacco. These habits strengthen your teeth, keep saliva flowing, and protect your overall well-being.</p>\n        <p>Need help building a healthier routine? Our team can create a personalized plan, provide gentle cleanings, and screen for early signs of disease so you can stay well from head to toe.</p>\n        <p>Proper oral care is more than just supporting a stunning smile. Your teeth can indicate a variety of health concerns that most don’t even think about. Did you know that neglecting your teeth and gums poses a risk to your oral and overall health? This can potentially cause issues or increase your risk for conditions that you might expect to be unrelated.</p>\n        <h2>Health Issues Caused or Exacerbated by Poor Oral Health</h2>\n        <p>Heart attack Stroke Osteoporosis Rheumatoid Arthritis Pneumonia Spread of Infection When problems arise, scheduling an appointment with a renovative dentist such as Dr. Alexie Aguil in West Hollywood can help you get to the root of the problem. Dr. Aguil and his team at Exquisite Dentistry will work out what the next steps are in your treatment plan and put you on the right track to achieve oral wellness.</p>\n        <h2>Healthy Teeth, Better Bones</h2>\n        <p>Many of us dread going to the dentist and put off our appointments until tooth decay has already set in. Would you do the same when it comes to visiting your cardiologist for acute chest pain? The answer is most likely “no”.</p>\n        <p>Unfortunately, oral health isn’t always a priority when it should be. People suffer through sensitive, cracked teeth every day without realizing a beautiful smile isn’t all that’s at stake. Teeth with damage or decay are at risk of infection or inflammation, which can affect your jaw and compromise the bone. Osteoporosis is a real threat for patients with weakened bone structures caused by oral health problems.</p>\n        <p>Cracked, injured teeth don’t repair themselves over time, meaning it’s up to you to take the initiative and seek treatment. Good oral and overall health are two forms of preventative care that can also give you beautiful teeth. Knowing your mouth like you know your body and learning how to take care of it is important for maintaining a fulfilling lifestyle and feeling good about it.</p>\n        <h2>Problems in Your Mouth, Problems Overall</h2>\n        <p>Most of us tend to take the words “heart condition” or “lung disease” more seriously than “periodontal disease,” despite strong evidence that oral health and heart health are interlinked. We take daily measures to prevent heart and lung disease from impacting our quality of life. Why shouldn’t we do the same for our oral health?</p>\n        <p>Our mouths are entry points for the different types of infection and bacteria we encounter every day. Oral health problems can be quick to develop in the teeth and gums where proper care and protection hasn’t been provided. From there, inflammation and bacteria can travel to other parts of the body and turn into a life-threatening problem affecting your oral and overall health.</p>\n        <p>When bacteria from infected teeth or gums enters the bloodstream, the results can be devastating. Poor oral health can cause heart attacks and stroke due to bacterial collecting in the arteries. If bacteria are in the lungs, it can turn into pneumonia.</p>\n        <p>Oral health problems can also help diagnose other unknown issues affecting the rest of the body. Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS can develop sores in their mouths as a side effect of immunodeficiency. Blood diseases and diabetes also impact your teeth and gums by weakening your body’s ability to fight infection, therefore increasing your risk of periodontal disease.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>A Healthy Diet Affects Oral and Overall Health</h2>\n        <p>Healthy eating and drinking also play a role in preventative care when it comes to problems with oral health. Due to the sugar content in most alcoholic beverages, patients who consume alcohol in moderation are less likely to develop periodontal diseases, stained teeth, or blood sugar disorders. Avoiding overindulgence with junk food is good for your teeth and your waistline.</p>\n        <h2>Minding Your Oral Health</h2>\n        <p>Preventative care and early treatments for oral and overall health problems are far better than waiting and addressing the problem when it might be too late.</p>\n        <h2>Knowing</h2>\n        <p>the signs for early oral cancer are important, but consulting professionals and having regular oral cancer screenings can help spot what our eyes cannot. If you’re a smoker, quitting is another healthy habit to pick up.</p>\n        <p>Female smokers are at a greater risk of developing oral cancer, which can go on to spread and affect their overall health. But it isn’t just tobacco smokers in danger: people who use marijuana are also more likely to develop severe oral health problems as well.</p>\n        <p>When you brush and floss properly, you’re removing food particles and bacteria that could otherwise build into plaque or tartar. Brushing twice a day for two minutes each can greatly reduce your chances of developing oral health problems. Getting an electric toothbrush and finding time to floss are two easy things you can add to your routine. Check out these 5 tips for improving oral care , even on a workday.</p>\n        <p>Even with daily care, schedule regular teeth cleanings . Consistent visits with dental professionals who can recognize early signs of oral health problems are the most efficient way to stay on top of your overall health.</p>\n        <h2>Healthy is Beautiful</h2>\n        <p>With so much depending on your mouth, you need to find a world-class dentist to help maintain your healthy lifestyle.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Valentine’s Day can still be sweet without leaving your teeth coated in sugar. Plan a cozy dinner at home featuring crunchy veggies, lean proteins, and fruit for dessert. Foods like strawberries, apples, and cheese help rinse away acids and keep your smile fresh for that end-of-the-night kiss.</p>\n        <p>If you exchange gifts, pair traditional treats with something smile-friendly. A new electric toothbrush, a set of flavored floss picks, or a whitening session you can enjoy together makes the gesture feel personal and thoughtful.</p>\n        <p>Finish the evening with a quick brush and floss so sugar does not linger overnight. Want to go the extra mile? Schedule a couples cleaning or whitening at our office for a lasting gift that keeps you both smiling long after the holiday.</p>\n        <p>Valentine’s Day is all about setting aside some time to be with your significant other and, for some, exchanging sugary treats. Whether you pick up a box of themed candy, or choose a sampler with dozens of assorted chocolates, February 14th has always been a day where it just feels right to sweeten things up. Chocolate is one of the more popular choices, and is considered to be a powerful aphrodisiac—but it’s also packed with sugar, and we don’t have to tell you it’s not tooth-friendly. But hey, it’s your day with your sweetheart, so we say indulge and enjoy!</p>\n        <p>Ok, dental health doesn’t sound sexy, but maybe that kiss will be. That’s why we are dedicated to helping you keep yours as healthy it can be. Here’s a few healthy Valentine’s Day ideas from Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry.</p>\n        <p>Cooking Together Making a meal with someone special is a fun way to spend your Valentine’s Day. This also gives you the opportunity to incorporate healthy ingredients—so you can focus on foods that taste great and doesn’t hurt your teeth. Recipes that contain lots of vegetables, cheeses, meats, and crunchy fruits are best for keeping teeth clean and strong.</p>\n        <p>For example, green leafy veggies such as kale and spinach are full of calcium and phosphorus—two minerals that are essential in strengthening tooth enamel. Cheese also contains calcium, and was reported by the American Academy of General Dentistry to raise pH levels in the mouth, which lowers your risk of tooth decay.</p>\n        <p>Fruits contain sugar, but the effects are diluted by the high water content that helps fight bacteria. The greatest benefit from fruits such as apples and pears comes their fiber, which can also give your teeth a good scrubbing before and after a meal. So, if spending the day together in the kitchen sounds good, find a tasty recipe and get cooking!</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <p>After Dinner Maybe cooking isn’t your thing, or you’re looking for a healthy Valentine’s Day idea that’s more tangible. Or perhaps you want a way to freshen up after a fancy, romantic dinner. There are dozens of dental products that you can give your partner on Valentine’s Day to maintain and improve dental health—and overall wellness.</p>\n        <p>Put together a gift basket with an electric or manual toothbrush, floss, a favorite flavor of toothpaste, and even a teeth-whitening kit. Brushing, flossing, and at-home whitening are activities you can do together, and will motivate you to take better care of your teeth—especially if you hold each other accountable. The couple that flosses together, stays together—or so we hear!</p>\n        <p>Of course, it probably goes without saying, but if you’re getting your partner a gift basket to promote their oral care, you better also get them something more romantic too!</p>\n        <p>If you and your partner want to prioritize oral health, Exquisite Dentistry provides a wide range of solutions—including routine cleanings , Zoom teeth whitening , and a wide variety of cosmetic dentistry services . Do something different this Valentine’s Day by giving the gift of healthy, beautiful teeth, and contact us for a consultation.

Start six months ahead with a dental visit to make sure your gums are healthy and to discuss whitening, Invisalign, or cosmetic touch-ups. Early planning gives you time to complete treatments and adjust your daily routine.</p>\n        <p>In the weeks leading up to the big day, brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss every night, and sip water after coffee, tea, or red wine to prevent stains. Schedule a professional whitening or polishing a week before the ceremony for a camera-ready glow.</p>\n        <p>On your wedding day, pack a mini kit with floss, a travel toothbrush, and lip balm. After the celebration, keep up your routine and visit the dentist for a post-wedding checkup—especially if clenching or late nights were part of the festivities.</p>\n        <p>Need help designing a bridal or groom smile plan? Our team can create a personalized timeline that keeps your teeth bright from engagement photos to the honeymoon.</p>\n        <h2>Essential Dental Care Tips for the Perfect Wedding Smile: Before, During, and After</h2>\n        <p>A wedding is one of the most memorable days in a person’s life. With all eyes on the bride and groom, it’s essential to ensure that your smile is as perfect as your outfit. A radiant smile boosts your confidence and enhances those precious photographs you’ll cherish forever. In this blog, we will provide essential dental care tips before, during, and after the big day to help you maintain that perfect wedding smile.</p>\n        <h2>Pre-Wedding Dental Care Planning</h2>\n        <p>Start Early Begin your dental care routine months before your wedding day. This gives you ample time to address any issues, from teeth whitening to more extensive dental work. Consult your dentist at least six months before the wedding to discuss your goals and create a personalized plan.</p>\n        <h2>Regular Dental Check-Ups</h2>\n        <p>Ensure you schedule regular dental check-ups. Professional cleanings can remove stubborn plaque and tartar, ensuring your teeth and gums are healthy. Your dentist can also identify and address any potential issues before they become significant problems.</p>\n        <p>Consider Invisalign Invisalign treatment is the perfect choice for those looking to discreetly straighten their teeth before their wedding day. Invisalign aligners are virtually invisible, making them ideal for brides and grooms who want to enhance their smiles without the noticeable look of traditional braces. With regular use and periodic adjustments, you’ll achieve a confident and stunning smile just in time for your special day.</p>\n        <h2>Teeth Whitening Options</h2>\n        <p>Consider professional teeth whitening treatments to achieve a dazzling smile, and make sure to consult your dentist to choose the best method for your teeth. Remember to avoid staining foods and beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine leading up to your wedding.</p>\n        <h2>Daily Dental Care Routine</h2>\n        <p>Maintaining teeth health is crucial for overall well-being, and keeping up with daily duties can play a significant role in this. Keep a strict brushing and flossing routine; brush your teeth at least twice a day using fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush, and floss daily to remove food particles and plaque between your teeth and gums. Additionally, you can also incorporate an antibacterial mouthwash into your daily routine to help eliminate bacteria, freshen your breath, and promote overall oral health.</p>\n        <h2>On the Wedding Day</h2>\n        <h2>Morning Dental Routine</h2>\n        <p>Start your wedding day with a thorough dental routine. Brush and floss your teeth meticulously. Use a whitening mouthwash to give your smile an extra sparkle.</p>\n        <p>Emergency Kit Prepare an emergency dental kit for the wedding day. Include items like floss, a small toothbrush, toothpaste, and whitening strips. This kit can be a lifesaver if you need a quick touch-up before photos or speeches.</p>\n        <h2>Post-Wedding Dental Care</h2>\n        <h2>Continue Your Routine</h2>\n        <p>After a day filled with drinking and eating, it’s vital to care for your teeth both that night and the morning after. The wedding may be over, but maintaining your radiant smile is essential for upcoming events like the after-party or post-wedding brunch. Be sure to brush and floss thoroughly and use mouthwash to eliminate any lingering bacteria.</p>\n        <p>Follow-Up Visits Consider scheduling a follow-up visit with your dentist to address any stress-related dental issues, such as grinding or clenching, that may have arisen during the wedding planning. Your dentist can offer custom solutions to prevent these problems from becoming long-term issues.</p>\n        <h2>Achieve a Wedding Ready Smile with Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n        <p>Achieving the perfect wedding smile requires careful planning and consistent effort.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Invisalign aligners move teeth gently, so you can expect light pressure when you switch to a new set. Most patients describe the feeling as mild soreness that fades within a couple of days. It is much less intense than the tightening visits that come with traditional braces.</p>\n        <p>If your mouth feels tender, switch to soft foods for a day, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, and keep your aligners in place so your teeth adjust faster. Because the trays are removable, you can take brief breaks to brush, eat, or give your mouth a rest—just remember to wear them 20–22 hours per day to stay on schedule.</p>\n        <p>Rough edges are rare but easy to fix. Let us know if an aligner irritates your cheeks or tongue, and we will smooth it or provide wax for added comfort. Throughout treatment we monitor your progress and adjust the pace to keep you comfortable and confident.</p>\n        <p>Curious whether Invisalign is right for you? Schedule a consultation. We will answer every question, show you a preview of your new smile, and outline exactly what to expect at each step.</p>\n        <p>If you’re smile isn’t everything you want it to be, you may feel like you have to settle for less than the best. Fortunately, this simply isn’t the case. Today, there are several different remedies to help correct crooked, misplaced teeth. Consistently, there’s one option that brings the best results and makes patients more satisfied than any other: Invisalign .</p>\n        <h2>What Is Invisalign?</h2>\n        <p>Invisalign is the premier option for those looking to straighten their teeth without the intrusion of traditional metal braces. Millions of people have used Invisalign since their introduction in 1999, and they have been a truly transformational product in the world of orthodontics.</p>\n        <p>Instead of using metal wires and brackets, Invisalign works completely differently. When you choose Invisalign, your orthodontist will create a mold of your mouth and take several scans of your teeth and their positioning. These will be used to fashion the Invisalign trays out of a durable high-tech plastic, which will gently begin to move your teeth into their desired position. Several sets of trays will be fashioned to continue to adjust the position of the teeth until they are in their optimal position.</p>\n        <h2>Why Choose Invisalign?</h2>\n        <p>There’s several smart reasons for choosing Invisalign. Some choose their devices for their convenience. Having the ability to take the trays in and out of your mouth means that you’re in control of the process, which is impossible with traditional braces. Also, old-fashioned metal braces require a following a long list of eating restrictions. No popcorn. No soda. No chewing gum. The list feels endless and can be quite restrictive.</p>\n        <p>Of course, the cosmetic value of Invisalign can’t be understated. Where traditional braces will fill your mouth with metal, the Invisalign trays are transparent and almost unnoticeable. Imagine the confidence boost you’ll receive from straightening your teeth with this advanced system!</p>\n        <h2>Is Invisalign Painful?</h2>\n        <p>Invisalign is a far less intrusive way to straighten your teeth than traditional braces, but many patients still ask the question—does Invisalign hurt? This is a fair question. Although everyone wants to have a smile they can be proud of, you don’t want to be in pain the entire time you’re mouth is undergoing its transformation.</p>\n        <p>Any time you’re having a procedure that involves moving teeth, there is going to be some discomfort involved. However, pain from Invisalign is generally considered to be much less than the pain caused by traditional braces. Most patients report that, while Invisalign does hurt for a few days after getting a new set of trays, the soreness is quite manageable—and significantly less than with traditional braces.</p>\n        <p>While Invisalign is less painful than traditional metal braces, we recommend you make an appointment with the dentist to discuss your concerns. At Exquisite Dentistry, one of the best dentists for Invisalign Braces in Southern California, we will work with you to make sure you’re completely comfortable with your treatment plan. We will be more than happy to help you answer the question, “Does Invisalign hurt?” Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>Invisalign Provides Options</h2>\n        <p>One of the best parts about the Invisalign process is how versatile it is, especially compared to metal braces. Because Invisalign trays are removable, if your Invisalign tray does hurt your teeth or gums, you can easily take them out to give your mouth some relief. Try doing that with metal braces!</p>\n        <p>Consider this scenario to understand the benefits of Invisalign. You have an important meeting at work, and you’ll be making the key presentation. However, the day before, you had an orthodontist appointment. If you have traditional braces, you likely woke up in pain with little hope of relief. All you can do is take a pain reliever and hope you feel better. However, if you have Invisalign, you likely have little to no discomfort whatsoever. If for some reason, Invisalign does cause your teeth to hurt, all you have to do is take it out. Simple! Invisalign works with your busy life.</p>\n        <p>One of the other benefits of Invisalign is that your dentist can work at whatever pace is comfortable for you. Invisalign’s system is easily customizable, allowing you to take things at a pace that is the most comfortable for you.</p>\n        <h2>Taking It One Tooth at a Time</h2>\n        <p>The slight hurt that does come from Invisalign aligners can be alleviated by focusing only on one part of your smile at a time rather than your entire mouth. Even if you do that, you’ll be surprised at the fast results you get. Nowadays, it can seem that everyone is going around with a nice, straight set of pearly whites. With Invisalign, you too can be flashing your confident smile in no time. Do you want a better idea of what your smile will look like?

But have you ever wondered why the same level of care and comfort isn’t readily available when it comes to visiting a cosmetic dentist for adults? What if you could enjoy your dental visit in a comfortable, stress-reducing environment? What if your dental appointment left you feeling the way you do after visiting a spa: calm, confident, and glowing?</p>\n        <p>That’s what we do at Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles. Step into our spa-like office designed with adult comfort in mind and experience a whole new level of dental care—one that genuinely prioritizes relaxation and your overall well-being. Our unique approach considers every aspect of your dental experience, from making an appointment to treatment to checkout and follow-up.</p>\n        <h2>Routine Dental Visits as Part of a Healthy Lifestyle</h2>\n        <p>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle encompasses more than just diet and exercise. The condition of your mouth plays a significant role in your body’s ability to function. Beyond the aesthetics of a bright smile, the health of your teeth and gums can have profound implications for your entire body.</p>\n        <h2>Research</h2>\n        <p>has shown that gum disease, caused by bacteria in the mouth, can contribute to the development of heart disease and increase the risk of stroke. As we become adults, the inflammation and infection associated with gum disease can also exacerbate existing heart conditions such as diabetes, HIV, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer’s.</p>\n        <p>Just as you visit the doctor for an annual checkup, even while getting adequate exercise and eating a balanced diet, so too should you visit the dentist for regular cleanings , even with proper oral hygiene habits. Each time you eat, you introduce bacteria into your mouth, which leads to plaque buildup on teeth. If not properly removed, plaque can contribute to gum disease and tooth decay. While brushing and flossing are effective at removing plaque from the surfaces of the teeth and between them, they may not eliminate all plaque.</p>\n        <p>Over time, this plaque hardens into tartar (or dental calculus), which cannot be removed by brushing and flossing alone. Professional dental tools, such as scalers and ultrasonic devices, are necessary to effectively remove tartar during a dental cleaning. That’s why regular dental cleanings are crucial for maintaining oral health and preventing gum disease in adults.</p>\n        <p>Furthermore, the alignment of your mouth also affects your overall health.</p>\n        <h2>Studies</h2>\n        <p>show that proper dental alignment can help prevent issues such as orofacial pain and temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ). Good alignment also promotes optimal oral hygiene by facilitating effective brushing and flossing and reducing the risk of plaque accumulation and gum disease. And don’t forget the power of proper teeth alignment to enhance confidence in social interactions and overall self-esteem. For adults, treatments like porcelain veneers and Invisalign are great options to straighten teeth, correct your bite, and improve your oral health.</p>\n        <p>In Los Angeles, Exquisite Dentistry makes it easy to see a cosmetic dentist for adults. Our practice is geared to the needs of those 16 years and up. Dr. Aguil and his team can help you avoid or remedy dental issues that could have a cascading impact on your overall physical and emotional well-being.</p>\n        <h2>Expect More from Your Experience</h2>\n        <p>Dr. Aguil pioneered the concept of the “dental spa” environment. He continues this dedicated approach today, providing a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere that complements world-class care.</p>\n        <p>From the moment you step into Exquisite Dentistry’s Los Angeles office, you’ll feel the difference. Enjoy a refreshing beverage when you arrive, decompress in serene exam rooms featuring tranquil lighting and aromatherapy, sink into our plush exam chairs with a warm blanket, put on noise-canceling headphones, and pick out your favorite music or Netflix show to lose yourself. Here, a comfortable experience isn’t just a luxury—it’s a key part of our exceptional care.</p>\n        <h2>Feel Good, Look Great</h2>\n        <p>As we mature, our teeth matter greatly to our appearance and health.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Treatment time depends on how much your teeth need to move. Mild crowding or spacing can often be corrected with Invisalign in about 6–12 months. More complex cases may take longer or require traditional braces, especially when back teeth need rotation or vertical movement.</p>\n        <p>During your consultation we assess your bite, take digital scans, and map out how each tooth will move. Invisalign aligners are switched every one to two weeks, guiding your smile into place step by step. Because the trays are clear and removable, they fit easily into busy adult schedules.</p>\n        <p>If braces are the better option, we will refer you to trusted orthodontic partners and coordinate your care. Either way, we support you with regular check-ins, comfort tips, and encouragement so you can stay on track.</p>\n        <p>Curious what timeline applies to you? Schedule a visit. We will show you a preview of your future smile and outline how long your personalized plan is likely to take.</p>\n        <p>Teeth straightening is becoming one of the most popular and sought-after cosmetic dentistry treatments. Traditionally, getting braces has been thought of as a straightening treatment for tweens and teenagers, but more and more adults these days are interested in improving their smiles. Whether for cosmetic reasons, improved dental health, or a combination of both, having a straighter smile can not only improve your self-confidence but can also help to prevent or treat issues such as gum disease, TMJ, and tooth decay.</p>\n        <p>The question then becomes how long does it take to fix crooked teeth in adults? Treatment with traditional metal braces can take up to two years. If you’re looking for a quicker fix for that perfect selfie at an upcoming wedding or you’re thinking about those graduation pictures at the end of your senior year, you’ll want to consider some of the newer options for correcting crooked teeth.</p>\n        <p>Clear aligners such as Invisalign are among the best ways of how to fix crooked teeth in adults. They can help move teeth quickly and are becoming one of the most popular options for straightening teeth. However, not everyone is a candidate for this type of orthodontia.</p>\n        <h2>Well—How Crooked Are They?</h2>\n        <p>If you ask your dentist the question of how long it will take to straighten your teeth, he or she will tell you that it depends on the severity of the problems. In cases involving severely crooked teeth, large gaps, and alignment problems, the more traditional metal braces are most likely the best option. Additionally, if there are issues with your back teeth or if there is a need to rotate teeth or move them vertically, metal braces may also be the better choice for you.</p>\n        <p>Invisalign is a great treatment option for adults wondering how to fix crooked teeth. Patients with more common issues such as overbites, underbites, crossbites, crowded or gapped teeth are the best candidates for Invisalign. The clear aligners are comfortable to wear, easy to use, and are very effective for straightening teeth and improving your smile without the pain and discomfort of traditional metal braces.</p>\n        <h2>How Long to Straighten Teeth? Faster Than You Think!</h2>\n        <p>If you’re feeling that it’s time to fix your crooked teeth and are wondering if Invisalign is the right treatment option for you, then it’s time to talk to Dr. Alexie Aguil , Invisalign dentist at Exquisite Dentistry in West Hollywood . His mission is to create that perfect smile for you or to enhance the one that you already have.</p>\n        <p>Invisalign is one of the best ways to give you the smile you’ve been looking for. Using this new teeth straightening technology, we will fit you with a custom-made series of aligners, specifically designed to shift your teeth into more ideal positions.</p>\n        <p>In the end, how long will it take to fix crooked teeth in adults? Although each case is unique, most patients need about 12 months to get the desired results from Invisalign. How does that compare with the length of time it takes to use traditional metal braces? Invisalign can usually straighten teeth in half the time as how long it takes to straighten teeth with metal braces.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>The Invisalign Difference</h2>\n        <p>The difference between Invisalign and traditional braces is clear . . . no pun intended! Patients love the cosmetic benefits that Invisalign offers. Where traditional braces fill your mouth with metal brackets and wires, Invisalign trays are made of clear, hard plastic. Because they’re transparent, they’re almost invisible to the eye. Most people won’t even know you’re wearing them. Compare that to how adults fix crooked teeth with metal braces!</p>\n        <p>Invisalign aligner trays are removable which makes for easier cleaning and overall maintenance. Because they can be taken in and out. They also allow you to eat whatever food you want. Of course, this is different from traditional metal braces, which are hard to brush and floss and have restrictions on what types of food you can eat. You won’t be able to chew gum, eat popcorn, hard candy, or a host of other foods and drinks. This isn’t the case with Invisalign, with which nothing is restricted.</p>\n        <p>Most patients also report that they feel considerably less pain with Invisalign as well. Any time teeth shift in the mouth, there is a level of discomfort. However, Invisalign patients can expect to deal with much less gum irritation and tenderness that they would from wearing metal braces. For all these reasons, you can see how Invisalign is the superior way to fix crooked teeth in adults.</p>\n        <h2>Invisalign From Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n        <p>For those who wonder how to fix crooked teeth in adults, you’ll need to remember that the length of time for how long it will take to straighten your teeth will vary. The amount of time and amount of trays needed to correct your dental issues can only be decided after an initial consultation. That means you’ll need a dentist who has the experience and know-how to give you the smile that you deserve. This is exactly why you should call Exquisite Dentistry.</p>\n        <p>Our high-end dentist office is different from many other dentists that you’ll find. We utilize the latest technology , like Invisalign, to make sure you have the best possible outcome every time you visit our office. We also have designed our practice to be more calming than a traditional dentist’s office.</p>\n        <p>When you step through the door, you’ll immediately feel the difference. Our waiting room is designed to look, feel, and even smell more like a day spa than a dentist’s office. When it’s time to be seen by Dr. Aguil , you’ll be seated in a comfortable chair and handed a warm blanket. While our expert team works their magic, you can watch your favorite TV show on Netflix using our noise cancelling headphones. It’s a soothing experience that’s unlike anything you’ll find almost anywhere else.</p>\n        <h2>Call Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n        <p>How long will you wait to straighten your teeth?</p>\n        <p>Contact us today to schedule a consultation with Exquisite Dentistry.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Healthy teeth support healthy aging. As we grow older, gums can recede, enamel can thin, and certain medications may dry the mouth, raising the risk of cavities. Regular dental visits help us spot changes early and adjust your care to keep your bite comfortable.</p>\n        <p>At home, brush twice a day with a soft toothbrush, floss daily, and drink plenty of water. Electric brushes and water flossers make cleaning easier if your hands feel stiff. Choose fluoride toothpaste and talk to us about prescription-strength options if you are prone to decay.</p>\n        <p>Nutrition matters too. Enjoy calcium-rich foods, crunchy fruits and vegetables, and limit sugary snacks. If you smoke, consider quitting—tobacco increases the risk of gum disease and oral cancer.</p>\n        <p>Our team offers gentle cleanings, fluoride treatments, screenings for oral cancer, and restorative care tailored to mature smiles. Schedule a visit to keep your mouth healthy so you can eat, speak, and laugh with confidence at every age.</p>\n        <p>Actor Anthony Hopkins once ironically stated, “Getting old ain’t for the faint of heart.” How true that is! But even if the rest of your body isn’t as young as it used to be, your smile doesn’t have to go with it. In fact, with diligent attention to oral care, mature adult teeth and gums can withstand the effects of aging.</p>\n        <p>Of course, it’s not just the cosmetic aspect of a beautiful smile that should concern you. Healthy teeth and gums are intrinsically linked to overall health, confidence, and the ability to enjoy a fulfilling lifestyle. Be true to your teeth and they won’t be false to you!</p>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n        <p>and his team at Exquisite Dentistry help patients of all ages achieve peak oral health. He’s often asked by his patients for advice on how to keep excellent oral health as a senior. If you’re trying to turn back the clock on your oral health, consider these tips as you strive for a healthier, brighter smile.</p>\n        <h2>Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body and Mind</h2>\n        <p>As a mature adult considering your oral health, you actually have to think beyond your teeth. The condition of your teeth and gums have a direct impact on the overall function of your body. Most older adults consider a visit to the dentist one of the least important health appointments on their calendar—and the easiest to cancel. However, this is a short-term solution that can cause long term problems you’ve likely never even considered.</p>\n        <p>If you have to limit what you eat due to cracked teeth or diseased gums, it can affect your overall nutrition. The ability to chew determines what and how much you can eat. You want to avoid becoming the older adult who can no longer enjoy a meal because of the sheer effort it takes to chew foods you love—a nice steak, a chewy bagel, or corn on the cob—because the texture is too much of a battle.</p>\n        <p>In addition, there’s the discomfort and infection that comes with gum disease and cavities. We all remember the agonizing pain from a childhood toothache; it doesn’t get any less painful as we age, and periodontal disease can be even worse.</p>\n        <p>Of course, gum disease doesn’t only affect your mouth. Far from it.</p>\n        <p>Study upon study has proven gum infections are contributing factors to heart disease, stroke, diabetes—and yes, even erectile dysfunction. Early research also indicates a connection between the bacterium from chronic gum disease and cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer’s. Of course, surgeons understand the link between gum disease and overall health. This is why a trip to the dentist for an oral care exam is often required for mature adults before major surgery. Many surgeons will not perform a scheduled procedure until they receive a clean bill of health from the patient’s dentist.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>How to Keep Excellent Oral Health for Seniors at Home</h2>\n        <p>One of the biggest boosts to at-home oral wellness is ultrasonic toothbrushes. They can dramatically eliminate bacteria and food caught between teeth. Pair this with regular flossing—ideally, once or twice daily—and you’ve made major inroads into limiting potential problems. Don’t forget that the key to good brushing is following the 2×2 principle; brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day for maximum results.</p>\n        <p>Older adults often ask Dr. Aguil about teeth bleaching products. While most packages of teeth bleaching products feature young models, they can provide good oral care for mature adults as well. Whiter teeth can take years off how you look and be a big confidence booster. If you need a more intensive approach, in-office treatments are the way to go. Consider Exquisite Dentistry’s Zoom Laser teeth whitening . We can help your teeth turn eight shades whiter in about an hour!</p>\n        <h2>How to Keep Up Oral Health for Seniors at the Dentist</h2>\n        <p>Dental care is a lifelong habit. Good oral care for mature adults includes regular teeth cleanings . Cleanings every three to six months are essential to prevent issues and to identify and treat problems. Like most everything else in life, early treatment is less invasive, time-consuming, and costly.</p>\n        <p>No matter how well we brush and floss at home there are areas, especially below the gum line, where it takes a trained hygienist to reach. Without it, bacteria and infection can grow and compromise the supporting bone and also lead to foul breath.</p>\n        <p>Sometimes, no matter how hard we try to take good care of our teeth, problems can arise.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Smoking or vaping marijuana can dry out your mouth and inflame gum tissue. When saliva decreases, bacteria stay on your teeth longer, increasing the risk of plaque buildup and gum disease. Research shows that regular cannabis users often develop deeper gum pockets, a sign that infection may be brewing below the surface.</p>\n        <p>Watch for warning signs such as bleeding when brushing, lingering bad breath, swelling, or gums pulling away from teeth. Let your dentist know about your marijuana use so we can tailor your cleanings, recommend fluoride or antibacterial rinses, and monitor your gums closely.</p>\n        <p>Good habits help balance the risk: brush twice a day, floss daily, drink plenty of water, and schedule professional cleanings every six months—or more often if we recommend it. If you are ready to protect your smile, book a visit. We will help you build a plan that keeps your gums healthy, no matter your lifestyle.</p>\n        <p>In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, legalizing recreational marijuana use across the state. Although marijuana was available in retail stores in 2018, many cities and municipalities still have not created regulations for the sale of marijuana, while other locations outright banned their sale. This has created a hodgepodge of rules that hindered Californian’s access to legal cannabis.</p>\n        <p>However, if you think this slowed down Californian’s appetite for pot, you’d be mistaken. Despite the issues with supply, it’s estimated that retailers in the state sold over 3 billion dollars worth of legal weed in 2018. This number is staggering and towers over the sales figures from other states where marijuana is legal.</p>\n        <p>With easier access to the drug, Californians 21 and older must consider the effects of using cannabis—including increased health risks, such as periodontal disease. According to a study featured in the Journal of Periodontology , people who use marijuana regularly “demonstrate increased indicators of mild, moderate, and severe gum disease.” In short, smoking marijuana hinders oral health.</p>\n        <h2>What Is Gum Disease?</h2>\n        <p>Periodontal disease is characterized by infections around your teeth, including the gums, alveolar bone, and periodontal ligament. While gum disease can settle in without pain, you can identify it early if you notice inflammation in the gum line or other symptoms such as receding gums, persistent bad breath, trouble chewing, loose teeth, and sensitive teeth or gums.</p>\n        <p>The most common known cause of gum disease is bacteria found the plaque that forms on your teeth. If plaque is not cleaned properly, it hardens into tartar—which cannot be removed by brushing and flossing. By keeping up with your regularly scheduled dental cleanings , you can reduce your plaque buildup, and in turn, minimize your risk of developing periodontal complications.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>What’s the Link Between Marijuana and Gum Disease?</h2>\n        <p>A common indicator of periodontal disease is the space between your teeth and their surrounding gum tissue. These “pocket depths” often tell dentists how likely patients are to develop periodontal disease. For example, healthy gum tissue fits closely around your teeth.</p>\n        <p>The study mentioned above found that marijuana users tend to have larger “pocket depths” than non-users, leaving users more exposed to bacterial infection. Simply put, marijuana users are more vulnerable to gum disease.</p>\n        <p>“At a time when the decriminalization of marijuana use is becoming more common in the U.S.,” says Dr. Terrence J. Griffin, president of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP), “users should be made aware of the impact that any form of cannabis can have on the health of their gums.” During your next check-up, be sure to notify your dentist of all risk factors, including regular marijuana use. Gum disease can be avoided! To learn more about how you can prevent periodontal disease, please reach out today to schedule an appointment!</p>\n      </div>",

We tailor treatment plans to your health history and make appointments relaxing with gentle techniques and sedation options when requested. Call us to build a plan that keeps your smile bright at every age.</p>\n        <h2>Everything You Need to Know About Caring for Your Oral Wellness with Age</h2>\n        <p>Actor Anthony Hopkins once ironically stated, “Getting old ain’t for the faint of heart.” How true that is! But even if the rest of your body isn’t as young as it used to be, your smile doesn’t have to fade. In fact, oral wellness with age gets easier as mature adult teeth and gums can withstand the effects of aging.</p>\n        <p>Of course, it’s not just the cosmetic aspect of a beautiful smile that should concern you. Healthy teeth and gums are intrinsically linked to overall health, confidence, and the ability to enjoy a fulfilling lifestyle.</p>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n        <p>and his team at Exquisite Dentistry help patients of all ages achieve peak oral health. His patients often ask him for advice on how to keep excellent oral health as a senior. If you’re trying to turn back the clock on your oral health, consider these tips as you strive for a healthier, brighter smile.</p>\n        <h2>Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body, and Mind</h2>\n        <p>As you age, it’s essential to consider the broader implications of oral health beyond just your teeth. Your dental well-being directly impacts your overall health and quality of life. Neglecting dental appointments can lead to long-term issues that affect your ability to enjoy a varied diet and maintain proper nutrition. Moreover, conditions like gum disease and cavities not only cause discomfort but also pose serious risks to systemic health, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and even cognitive decline.</p>\n        <p>In addition, some discomforts and infections come with gum disease and cavities. We all remember the agonizing pain from a childhood toothache; it doesn’t get any less painful as we age, and periodontal disease can be even worse.</p>\n        <p>Of course, gum disease doesn’t only affect your mouth.</p>\n        <p>Many studies have proven gum infections are contributing factors to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Early research also indicates a connection between the bacterium from chronic gum disease and cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer’s. Of course, surgeons understand the link between gum disease and overall health. This is why a trip to the dentist for an oral care exam is often required for mature adults before major surgery since many surgeons won’t perform a scheduled procedure until they receive a clean bill of health from the patient’s dentist.</p>\n        <h2>How to Maintain Excellent Oral Health at Home</h2>\n        <p>Investing in an ultrasonic toothbrush can significantly improve your at-home oral care routine by effectively removing bacteria and food particles. Combine this with regular flossing—ideally done once or twice daily—to further reduce the risk of dental problems. Remember to adhere to the 2×2 principle: brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day for optimal results.</p>\n        <h2>Routine Dental Visits</h2>\n        <p>Dental care is a lifelong habit. Oral wellness with age includes practices like regular teeth cleanings every three to six months to prevent issues and identify and treat problems. Like everything else, early treatment is less invasive, time-consuming, and costly. An annual oral cancer screening is imperative to catching potential issues early on. Like your routine physical or mammogram, this simple screening can detect signs of oral cancer in its earliest stages, when treatment is most effective. Our VELscope Vx is an advanced oral screening device that can catch oral cancer in its earliest stages Regardless of how well we brush and floss at home, areas, especially below the gum line, take a trained hygienist to reach. These hard-to-reach spaces can harbor plaque and tartar buildup, which, if left untreated, can lead to gum disease and other oral health issues. Neglected areas can also contribute to foul breath, affecting oral health, overall confidence, and well-being.</p>\n        <p>A skilled hygienist is vital in performing thorough cleanings, removing stubborn plaque and tartar, and ensuring that your teeth and gums are healthy and free from harmful bacteria. Proper daily dental hygiene and a dental visit every 4-6 months are essential for maintaining oral wellness. Sometimes, no matter how hard we try to take good care of our teeth, problems can arise. The idea is to minimize teeth replacement—having just one or two tooth implants is much better than a full set of dentures.</p>\n        <h2>Illuminate Your Smile</h2>\n        <p>Teeth bleaching products can also benefit mature adults by enhancing the brightness of their smile and boosting confidence. Whether preparing for a special occasion or simply looking to rejuvenate your smile, teeth whitening options can be a game-changer.</p>\n        <p>For a more intensive approach, consider our in-office Zoom Laser teeth whitening treatment .

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Flossing once a day keeps plaque and gum inflammation in check, but busy schedules make it easy to forget. Try these simple strategies to make flossing second nature.</p>\n        <p>Set a visual cue. Keep floss in a dish beside your toothbrush or stick a note on your mirror. Seeing the floss reminds you to reach for it before the day slips away.</p>\n        <p>Pair flossing with a routine you already have. Floss right after your morning coffee, while the shower warms up, or as you start your favorite evening show. When habits live together, they are easier to keep.</p>\n        <p>Keep it comfortable. If traditional string feels tricky, explore floss picks, reusable floss holders, or a water flosser. Pick the tool that fits your hands and lifestyle so the habit sticks.</p>\n        <p>Aim for a 30-day streak. Mark each success on a calendar—small wins build momentum. Soon you will be able to answer “yes” when your dental team asks about flossing, and your gums will thank you with less bleeding and fresher breath.</p>\n        <p>“Do you floss?” the dentist asks you as you settle into the chair for your appointment.</p>\n        <p>You say yes. But the barely used box of floss that’s been sitting in your medicine cabinet for a year has a different story to tell!</p>\n        <p>Many of us are guilty of forgetting to floss. You have a bus to catch, or kids to take to school, or you just want to go to bed. We get it. But among the American Dental Association’s oral care recommendations, flossing once a day is a necessary step in your oral health care regimen. That’s just two additional minutes out of your day, all to ensure your smile stays healthy.</p>\n        <p>Here at Exquisite Dentistry , we consider ourselves a team—with a common goal. So, here are a few painless recommendations to help you work flossing into your daily routine.</p>\n        <h2>Create a Visual Reminder</h2>\n        <p>Visual cues remind you about your goals. Put a sticky note on your mirror with “FLOSS” spelled out in bold. Keep your floss right in front of your toothbrush. Set a reminder on your phone. Do anything that will trigger your memory and get you flossing.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>Build on Top of Another Habit</h2>\n        <p>Building a tiny habit like flossing is completely doable. It’s even easier if you associate it with another habit. Try flossing before you brush your teeth in the morning. Perhaps you could floss right when you get out of the shower. If you watch SportsCenter every night, why not floss right when it starts? This is called habit “chunking,” an unpleasant name with pleasant consequences.</p>\n        <h2>Make It Fun</h2>\n        <p>Flossing can be fun? Just look to Chonpe , a monkey in Japan who loves to floss. It is possible! Use the two minutes spent flossing to practice your mindfulness . . . or blissfully zone out. Listen to a good podcast or cue up a funny YouTube video. If all else fails, why not mix things up with some flossing gadgets? Flosstime, a sleek new floss dispenser, sticks right to your mirror and lights up with a blue smile when you floss once a day. Be warned—it turns into a frown if you skip a day!</p>\n        <p>Commit to 30 Days There are conflicting reports on how many days it takes to develop a new habit. Some say 21, while others say there’s no magical timeline. Our recommendation is that you commit to flossing every day for 30 days. You can even mark each day with an “X” on your calendar to keep yourself motivated. At day 31, we’re hoping you’ll be reaching for the floss without even having to think about it.</p>\n        <p>Now the next time your dentist asks you if you floss, we hope you can truthfully say “Yes!” No more white lies—just white teeth and healthy gums. Your smile will thank you for it.</p>\n        <p>Of course, flossing is only a small part of your oral healthcare routine. Don’t forget to keep up with your regular dental appointments , including teeth cleaning and annual oral cancer screening .</p>\n        <p>Exquisite Dentistry is here to help!</p>\n        <p>Contact us today and set up your appointment at West Hollywood’s premiere dental spa.</p>\n      </div>",

Use scissors to open packages and keep chewy foods in small pieces.</li><li>If you grind or clench, wear a nightguard. Protect your veneers with a custom mouthguard during sports or high-impact activities.</li><li>Visit us twice a year for cleanings and checkups. We will polish your veneers, check the bond, and catch any concerns early so small adjustments keep them looking their best.</li></ul>\n        <p>Thinking about new veneers or ready to refresh an older set? Schedule a consultation. We will review your goals, discuss maintenance tips, and design a plan that keeps your smile radiant for years.</p>\n        <p>For patients looking for a beautiful, radiant smile, dental veneer restoration may be the answer. Veneers are translucent, yet durable pieces of porcelain that are bonded to the front of teeth to enhance their color and shape, as well as fix damage. They can also close gaps between teeth.</p>\n        <p>Veneers are a relatively simple solution to transforming a smile in 3 visits to your cosmetic dentist. High-quality porcelain veneers often last many years, and can last 20 years with proper care. Then, it’s time for a cosmetic dentist to help restore them.</p>\n        <p>Veneer restoration typically involves three visits to the dentist. During the first visit, your cosmetic dentist will make a mold of your teeth. On your second visit, temporary veneers will be applied to your teeth, allowing you to “test drive” your selection. At the final visit, you’ll have the temporary veneers removed and the permanent veneers bonded into place. Before you know it, you’ll be on your way with a brand new, stunning smile !</p>\n        <p>Proper veneer maintenance is the best way to get the most out of your new smile. By making proper veneer maintenance a priority, you can get additional years out of their lifespan.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>At Exquisite Dentistry of Los Angeles,</h2>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n        <p>works hard to make sure that patients get the highest-quality veneers possible. Once you leave the office after your final veneer restoration appointment, there are several steps you need to take to ensure you’ll get the most out of your new smile. Consider these five tips to help you maintain your new veneers.</p>\n        <h3>1. Brush and Floss</h3>\n        <p>This may seem like common sense, but it’s vitally important to regularly brush and floss. By cleaning away the plaque, you can avoid tartar buildup that hinders the look of your veneers. Cleaning food particles out of your teeth and gums will help prevent dental caries, as well as an infection.</p>\n        <p>When you’re brushing and flossing, don’t forget to: Brush two by two.</p>\n        <p>This means you need to brush for two minutes in the morning and two minutes in the evening. Don’t cut the time short; set a timer to ensure you don’t shortchange your brushing time.</p>\n        <p>Use a proper toothbrush.</p>\n        <p>Just as a carpenter needs to have the proper tools when they work, you need the right tool for maintaining your veneer restoration. A soft to medium bristle is best for the job. Additionally, make sure you change your brush every three months or sooner if the bristles are worn.</p>\n        <p>Floss once a day.</p>\n        <p>Many people neglect to floss, which is a detriment to their veneers and their overall oral health. For ease of use, many people prefer to use pre-strung floss picks.</p>\n        <h3>2. Use Your Teeth the Right Way</h3>\n        <p>We’ve all used our teeth for something we shouldn’t have at one time or another. Whether it’s tearing open a package, chewing ice, or as an impromptu tool, we’ve all made the mistake before.</p>\n        <p>Misuse of your teeth can be harmful to your oral health. For those with veneer restoration, it can be even more damaging. Proper veneer upkeep requires that you don’t use your teeth as tools for anything besides eating. Although veneers are firmly bonded to your teeth, they’re not impervious to misuse. Take care of your veneers, and they’ll take care of you!</p>\n        <h3>3. Avoid Grinding Your Teeth</h3>\n        <p>Porcelain veneers are extremely durable. They’re almost as resilient as your natural enamel. Those who deal with bruxism (teeth grinding) should understand that even these hard surfaces can be worn down over time due to constant teeth grinding.</p>\n        <p>If you deal with teeth grinding, have an honest conversation with your dentist before receiving veneer restoration treatment. They can offer a solution like a dental mouth guard, which can keep the teeth from grinding. Your dentist can also offer other alternate solutions, such as stress management or biofeedback to help deal with the problem at its root cause.</p>\n        <h3>4. Use a Mouthguard for Sports</h3>\n        <p>Do you enjoy playing in a local rec league? How about your company’s softball team? No matter your sport of choice, everyone should make sure they utilize a well-fitting mouthpiece. However, this is even more important if you have had veneer restoration.</p>\n        <p>Speak to your dentist about having a custom-fitted mouthguard created for you to aid in proper veneer upkeep.</p>\n        <h3>5. Visit the Dentist Regularly</h3>\n        <p>It would be a shame to have a beautiful veneer restoration and then neglect to see the dentist for your semi-annual teeth cleaning and exam . Unfortunately, patients routinely miss their twice-a-year visit to the dentist. By doing so, they limit the overall lifespan of their veneers.</p>\n        <p>Before you leave the office from your final veneer appointment, make sure you schedule your next six-month checkup. If you wait until later to call, you’ll likely forget. Many patients are shocked that it’s been two or three years since their last exam, simply because time got away from them. Your veneers deserve better, so keep on a regular examination schedule.</p>\n        <h2>Veneer Restoration From Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n        <p>If you live in the Los Angeles area, schedule a visit with Dr. Aguil’s team at Exquisite Dentistry .

Treatment can be as short as six to twelve months, and you can remove the trays for meals, brushing, and special events.</p>\n        <p>Porcelain veneers reshape your smile in as few as three visits.

When it comes to straightening teeth for adults, his two most effective methods are Invisalign treatment and porcelain veneers .</p>\n        <h2>The Best Methods for Teeth Straightening</h2>\n        <p>For many, crooked teeth are the biggest obstacle preventing adults from having an A-list smile. Traditional braces are the first thing we think about when it comes to adult teeth straightening. Our second thought typically goes to former classmates in our younger years who had their braces for years.</p>\n        <p>If braces for adult teeth are keeping you from perfecting your smile, there are better ways to do it. A cosmetic dentist like Dr. Alexie Aguil can work with you to find an option like Invisalign that works for you and your lifestyle.</p>\n        <h2>Top Teeth Straightening Treatments</h2>\n        <h2>Invisalign Clear Aligners</h2>\n        <p>Traditional and lingual braces work. But there is one method that works faster and more comfortably, and you can even take them out to eat and take photos. For most, the best method for straightening your teeth is Invisalign .</p>\n        <p>Invisalign has been rapidly gaining popularity and earning praise over the last 20 years . Dr. Alexie Aguil, one of the leading providers of Invisalign in the United States, praises its teeth straightening technology and superiority over traditional braces for adult teeth. Invisalign is efficient at correcting your smile without self-consciousness slowing you down.</p>\n        <p>Life doesn’t have to change just because you’re straightening your teeth. Every day, your dream smile gets closer to reality, and the people around you may not even notice. You’ll visit your dentist only often enough to be fitted for new aligners, each one straighter than the last as they work their magic.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>How Invisalign Works</h2>\n        <p>At Exquisite Dentistry, your journey towards straighter teeth starts on day one. With our advanced scanning technology, you’ll be able to see what your teeth will look like after treatment is complete.</p>\n        <p>You’ll be sent a set of clear aligners every week. This teeth-straightening process continues until the desired results are achieved, sometimes in as little as 6 months. Treatment can be flexible to keep your mouth comfortable. Some Invisalign patients report slight discomfort when wearing their new aligners, but generally, Invisalign is a painless process . Your teeth can even be shifted one at a time in order to alleviate some discomfort.</p>\n        <p>Exquisite Dentistry is also one of the few practices that offers Fast Track™ Aligner Accelerator. Patients can be proud of their smiles in less time, all thanks to a specialized dental practice they can trust. It’s easy to see why so many celebrities and professionals are turning to Invisalign for straighter teeth instead of braces.</p>\n        <p>Porcelain Veneers Dental veneers are a great fix for damaged, misaligned, or discolored teeth, as well as teeth with unwanted gaps. With only 3 appointments required, veneers are one of the quickest ways of straightening adult teeth. At Exquisite Dentistry, patients can achieve their perfect smile in just three simple visits as opposed to months of teeth-straightening visits for traditional braces.</p>\n        <p>Veneers are made from thin porcelain and placed over existing teeth for natural-looking results. Digital scans are taken of the teeth in need of correction, giving patients a chance to work with Dr. Aguil to help design their ideal smile. A small section of the tooth is buffed down and replaced by a temporary until the permanent porcelain veneers arrive.</p>\n        <p>Patients with veneers can eat with and brush their teeth just like they normally would. For adults wanting straighter teeth, there’s no other method this easy, or with better results.</p>\n        <h2>Traditional Braces Aren’t for Everyone</h2>\n        <p>Besides being indiscreet, traditional braces are often uncomfortable and inconvenient. While lingual braces are harder to spot, the lisp they cause is often more prominent. For professionals in need of a jaw-dropping smile without the obvious signs, traditional braces for adults are not the way to go.</p>\n        <p>The frequent maintenance needed for both types of braces often leaves patients frustrated. They’ll also need to take extra steps when brushing and flossing.</p>\n        <p>By Contrast, clear aligners and porcelain veneers are easy to care for. Your clear aligners can be cleaned or even removed before bed. And veneers can be brushed and flossed like any other tooth.</p>\n        <h2>It’s Time to Embrace Your Smile</h2>\n        <p>Adults wanting straighter teeth don’t have to hide their smile. If clear aligners or veneers are right for your lifestyle, Exquisite Dentistry can give you the healthy, camera-ready smile you’ve been waiting for. Located in Los Angeles, Exquisite Dentistry specializes in adult oral health. For patients, the result is an unrivaled and comfortable experience that makes going to the dentist less stressful.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Porcelain veneers are an investment in a brighter, more confident smile. In Los Angeles, high-quality veneers typically range from $1,800 to $2,500 per tooth. Many patients choose to treat 8–10 teeth that show when they smile, while others refresh their full arch for complete symmetry. During your consultation we provide a detailed estimate based on your goals, the number of veneers, and any preparatory care needed.</p>\n        <p>Why do veneers cost more than whitening or bonding? Premium porcelain looks and feels like natural enamel, resists stains, and is handcrafted by expert ceramists. Combined with digital planning and a cosmetic dentist’s artistry, veneers deliver a customized result that lasts a decade or longer with good care.</p>\n        <p>Insurance often considers veneers elective, but we review every plan to see if any portion—such as restorations on damaged teeth—can be covered. We also offer flexible payment options to make treatment more comfortable.</p>\n        <p>Curious what your dream smile would cost? Schedule a consultation. We will design a personalized plan, share a preview of your results, and walk you through timing, pricing, and financing step by step.</p>\n        <p>A brilliant smile is priceless. Here in Los Angeles, celebrities and business leaders are famous for the smiles their careers are built on. If you want a world-class smile, this city is the place to make it happen.</p>\n        <p>Celebrities worldwide achieve this with porcelain veneers , a dental treatment for shaping, aligning, and coloring their teeth with a completely natural appearance. So what is the cost of dental veneers in Los Angeles, and what makes them worth it?</p>\n        <h2>Price of the Highest-Quality Dental Veneers</h2>\n        <p>Typical Cost: About $20,000 for a 10-unit veneer design.</p>\n        <h2>Cost for All Teeth:</h2>\n        <p>About $50,000 for a 32-unit veneer design Cost per Tooth: $1800 to $2500 The cost can be dependant on the number of teeth treated. The price may also vary due to diagnostic costs and the delivery method that is used.</p>\n        <h2>Why The Best Dental Veneers are Well-Worth the Price</h2>\n        <h2>A Natural Look</h2>\n        <p>Top-quality porcelain veneers are virtually indistinguishable from natural teeth.</p>\n        <p>World-Class Comfort Exquisite Dentistry in West Hollywood is the original dental spa.

But not every set of veneers is made with the same quality and care. You could go with one of these other options to cut down on the cost of veneers for your teeth, but it’s not recommended.</p>\n        <p>Discount veneers cut all sorts of corners. They’re often made in China, and not well-customized to fit your mouth. Expect to see that fake plastic look; the color gives them away every time. And forget reliability. High-end porcelain veneers are expected to last a decade or longer, but you’ll need to replace cheap veneers much sooner than you expect.</p>\n        <p>Save yourself the trouble, the pain, and the potential embarrassment of low-cost veneers on your teeth.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Veneers can be crafted from two main materials: porcelain and composite resin. Understanding the differences helps you choose the option that fits your goals, budget, and timeline.</p>\n        <p>Porcelain veneers are the gold standard. They are custom-made in a dental lab, mimic the translucency of natural enamel, and resist staining from coffee, wine, and tea. With good care they often last 10–15 years. Because they require more planning and multiple visits, the initial cost is higher, but the long-term durability and natural look make them a smart investment.</p>\n        <p>Composite veneers are sculpted directly onto the tooth in a single visit. They cost less up front and are easy to repair, but the material can stain over time and is more likely to chip or wear down. They are a good choice for minor touch-ups or when you need a temporary solution.</p>\n        <p>During your consultation we will evaluate your smile, listen to your expectations, and recommend the material that best balances beauty, longevity, and value. If you are ready to design your ideal smile, schedule a visit—we will guide you through every option.</p>\n        <p>If you’re looking for an easy way to make extraordinary improvements to your smile, veneers are the perfect option. Dental veneers are thin, translucent coverings that are placed over the front of a tooth, instantly transforming a problematic tooth into a perfect one. Veneers are a wonderful fit for several types of cosmetic dentistry uses, including: Tooth discoloration: Although teeth whitening is often a popular choice to achieve a whiter, brighter smile, veneers can accomplish the same job. Veneers are a good option when there are other issues to address along with tooth discoloration, allowing you to address multiple problems at the same time. Additionally, on the rare occasions there are tooth-coloring issues that cannot be solved through traditional whitening measures, veneers are also an appropriate choice.</p>\n        <p>Cracked or chipped teeth: Although enamel is the hardest surface in the human body, it’s not impervious to cracking. If a tooth has cracked through eating, a blow to the mouth, or from some other trauma, a veneer may be helpful in these situations.</p>\n        <p>Worn teeth: Those that grind their teeth will wear them down over time. When this occurs, veneers can restore the shape and function of the teeth.</p>\n        <p>Gaps between teeth: If teeth are misshapen, or if they have small gaps between them, veneers are an option to restore function and beauty to the smile.</p>\n        <p>How do you know if veneers are the best choice for your situation? When you visit your dentist, they will assess the issues that are hindering your smile from reaching its fullest potential and give you options for restoring the look and function of your teeth. If you deal with some of the conditions listed above, you’re likely a good candidate for dental veneers . Whether you need to transform a few teeth or all 32, high-quality veneers can be a game-changer.</p>\n        <h2>What Materials are Veneers Made Of?</h2>\n        <p>If you’re considering veneers , there’s an important choice you’ll need to make before you get too far in the process: you’ll need to select veneers made from either porcelain or composite resin. The type of material used for your veneers will in large part determine the overall outcome of your treatment. There are pros and cons to each option. Yet, at Exquisite Dentistry, we have a belief that one material is far superior to the other. Dr. Alexie Aguil has worked with patients who have experienced both types of veneers, and the feedback he’s received over the years has made it clear which option patients prefer.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>Veneer Material: Medical-Grade Porcelain</h2>\n        <p>Many dentists prefer to use FDA-approved dental porcelain to fashion their veneers. Although some would point to their higher initial price, there are numerous advantages to porcelain veneers.</p>\n        <p>Pros of Porcelain veneers: Offer a more natural look than composite resin Compare to the hardness of enamel, allowing them to be extremely resistant to chipping Last about ten years, but often last much longer with good oral care and regular dental checkups Can aid in fixing more serious cosmetic blemishes Extremely resistant to staining, meaning veneers will retain their color over time.</p>\n        <p>A lower-cost option over the longer term, since they are more durable than less expensive materials used to create inexpensive veneers Cons of Composite veneers Come at a higher short-term investment Although porcelain veneer material represents a more significant initial investment than composite veneers, in the long run, you’ll have a better overall experience.</p>\n        <h2>Veneer Material: Composite Resin</h2>\n        <p>Resin is a tooth-colored material that is shaped over the exterior of the tooth and then bonded in place. You’ll find that composite resin veneers are often found at a relatively low cost, and there are a couple of reasons for this: Compared to medical-grade porcelain, composite resin is less expensive material and process to use.</p>\n        <p>Composite veneers can be placed over teeth in only one visit to the dentist, compared to three visits with porcelain.</p>\n        <p>There are both positive and negative qualities of resin as the material for your veneers.</p>\n        <p>Pros of Composite veneers Result in lower overall costs for the patient (in the short-term) More easily fixed or replaced if damaged Cons of Composite veneers Can discolor over time Not resistant to wear and tear like porcelain veneers Often lack a natural appearance, leading to a fake or plastic smile Choose Exquisite Dentistry for Porcelain Veneers Because of the all-encompassing look, feel, and outcome from porcelain veneers, Dr. Alexie Aguil only offers this veneer option at Exquisite Dentistry.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Porcelain veneers can shine for many years, but eventually they may chip, stain, or lose their luster. When that happens, replacement keeps your smile looking fresh. Here is what to expect.</p>\n        <p>We start with an evaluation to check the bond, underlying tooth, and gum health. If replacement is needed, we gently remove the old veneer and take new digital impressions. This is your chance to adjust the shape or shade if you want a slightly different look.</p>\n        <p>Temporary veneers protect your teeth while the new porcelain is crafted. At the final visit we bond the updated veneers in place, refine the bite, and polish the edges. The process feels similar to getting your first set, and we use the same spa-like comforts to keep you relaxed.</p>\n        <p>To extend the life of your new veneers, brush and floss daily, avoid using your teeth as tools, wear a nightguard if you grind, and keep up with twice-yearly cleanings. Ready to refresh your smile? Schedule a consultation so we can plan your veneer update together.</p>\n        <p>Dental veneers are an outstanding investment in your smile. They last many years with exceptional care. Just like natural teeth, they will show signs of wear over time. Then it’s time to consult a cosmetic dentist on veneer replacement.</p>\n        <h2>Extending the Life of Your Veneers</h2>\n        <p>Because they are a cosmetic procedure that health insurance companies don’t generally cover, dental veneers are usually a sizable investment for the patients who get them. So individuals who choose veneers should understand the following: Veneers are not permanent, even those made with the highest-quality materials Veneers can be broken, damaged, or stained, just like regular teeth Patients that are vigilant about brushing, flossing and seeing their dentist for regular checkups and cleanings have the best results People who stay vigilant about their oral care will prolong the life-span of their veneers. That could mean a few extra years before they need veneer replacement. Being dedicated to maintaining your veneers, your smile, and your oral health only takes a little extra effort.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>Ways to Extend the Life of Your Veneers</h2>\n        <p>Avoid using tobacco products and eating or drinking things that can stain teeth (pasta sauce, wine, coffee, dark soda, etc.) Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and ask your dentist about a non-abrasive toothpaste that you can start using every day Start wearing a mouthguard when playing sports (for protection) and wear a night guard when you sleep Can you be perfect for the life of your veneers? That’s a tall order. You’ll likely get a soda at lunch here and there or jump into a game of basketball without your mouthguard at some point. However, keeping the investment value of your veneers in mind is usually enough motivation to keep them in the best shape possible.</p>\n        <p>The day will eventually come when your veneers need replacement. And at that point, you’ll need to talk to your dentist about the veneer replacement process.</p>\n        <h2>Replacing Veneers: What to Expect</h2>\n        <p>Getting a new set of veneers fitted is very much like getting your first veneers. Your dentist will remove the old veneers and buff the outer layer of the tooth.</p>\n        <p>With the old veneers removed, your dentist will take a new mold of your teeth and order the new veneers based on that mold to match your other teeth as closely as possible. This is the perfect time to change the design or shade of your smile if you want. Once the veneers have been created and shipped back to the dentist, they will attach the veneers to the teeth, just like the original procedure to get the veneers positioned for the perfect smile.</p>\n        <h2>Call Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n        <p>When it comes to veneers, you’ll be able to call Exquisite Dentistry and have Dr. Alexie Aguil guide you through the entire experience.

We will walk you through every shape, tailor the style to your goals, and guide you from temporary veneers to the final polished set.</p>\n        <p>Dental veneers have become a popular way for people in Los Angeles to significantly improve their smile.

He’s worked with hundreds of patients, and their beautifully restored smiles speak for themselves!</p>\n        <h2>Choosing</h2>\n        <p>Veneer Shapes : The Background of Veneers So, what are dental veneers ? They’re thin, yet durable pieces of FDA-approved, medical-grade materials bonded directly to the teeth. Veneers are able to cover a host of different issues that cause smiles to lose their radiance: Cosmetic issues: Veneers have become a go-to cosmetic dentistry treatment because of how easily they are able to cover minor cosmetic issues. Although some people choose our Zoom! Advanced Teeth Whitening system , we’ve found that many of our patients love how veneers easily bring the shine back to their smile.</p>\n        <p>Structural issues: Not only can veneers help make teeth whiter and brighter, but they can also help solve a multitude of structural issues. Teeth that are chipped, cracked, or that have gaps between them can see remarkable results with porcelain veneers.</p>\n        <p>How do you know if veneers are the best option for your teeth?</p>\n        <p>Schedule a consultation with Exquisite Dentistry, and Dr. Aguil will work with you to choose the best options for your treatment.</p>\n        <h2>Choosing Veneer Shapes: Your Treatment Plan</h2>\n        <p>Most patients are surprised at how simple the process of receiving dental veneers can be.

Using his expertise and guidance, they’ll work together to begin crafting your veneers.</p>\n        <p>Visit #2: To begin, Dr. Aguil will buff off a small layer of each tooth, giving the veneer a secure surface for bonding. Then, he’ll carefully affix a temporary veneer to your tooth, which will last until your next appointment.</p>\n        <p>During this time, you’ll evaluate the veneer shape and color. Once you’ve settled on the perfect veneer style and fit, your permanent veneers will be readied.</p>\n        <p>Visit #3: Your temporary veneers will be removed and your permanent veneers will be bonded to your teeth.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Veneers are one of the most reliable ways to reshape a smile quickly. They cover discoloration, smooth chips, close spaces, and create a balanced tooth shape. Because they are custom-designed and crafted, they do require an investment—typically $2,000–$2,500 per tooth in Los Angeles—but the results can last a decade or more with proper care.</p>\n        <p>Our process includes three visits: consultation and digital planning, a preparation appointment with temporary veneers, and final placement of handcrafted porcelain. You can preview the shape and shade before we bond anything permanently, and we make adjustments until your smile feels just right.</p>\n        <p>Veneers may not be ideal if you have active gum disease, large cavities, or very crowded teeth. In those cases we may recommend periodontal treatment or Invisalign before considering veneers. During your consultation we assess your oral health and outline every option so you can choose what fits your goals.</p>\n        <p>Ready to learn if veneers are worth it for you? Schedule a visit. We will review costs, timelines, financing, and maintenance tips so you can make a confident, informed decision.</p>\n        <p>Are you looking to enhance your smile and boost your confidence?</p>\n        <p>Dental veneers offer the best solution that can transform the appearance of your teeth, addressing issues such as discoloration, chipping, misalignment, and irregularities in shape.</p>\n        <p>As a top cosmetic dentist in Los Angeles , Dr. Alexie Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry understands the importance of making informed decisions about your dental investments. In this article, Dr. Aguil answers some common questions and provides insights into whether veneers are a good investment for you.</p>\n        <p>What are dental veneers and what do they help with?</p>\n        <p>Dental veneers are thin, custom-made shells made of porcelain or composite resin that are bonded to the front surface of teeth, often in addition to dental crowns. They help improve the appearance of teeth by addressing issues such as discoloration, chipping, misalignment, or irregularities in shape. At Exquisite Dentistry, we use the highest-quality materials to ensure that our veneers are of the utmost quality. Through a meticulous process involving digital impressions, professional ceramists, and careful adjustments, we craft the most refined, natural-looking veneers for each of our patients. The LA market, in general, wants a super white, Hollywood smile, so Dr. Aguil uses his “special powers” to finesse the most natural-looking shade of dazzling white.</p>\n        <p>How soon do veneers work?</p>\n        <p>Veneers can give you a whole new set of teeth nearly immediately. The results of veneers are fast and dramatic, with our patients having their final veneers in as little as 3 to 6 weeks.</p>\n        <p>Our veneer process at Exquisite Dentistry typically involves several visits. During the evaluation and modeling visit, we capture digital impressions and work with a professional ceramist to design a model of your porcelain veneers. Dr. Aguil and his ceramist have custom-crafted veneers together for many years. In the veneer preparation visit, the temporary restorations are set until the final veneers are complete. Patients are then provided a two-week trial period to assess their veneers’ look, feel, and function. The third visit involves finalizing and bonding the custom porcelain veneers, ensuring the shape and color are exactly right for you.</p>\n        <p>How long do veneers last?</p>\n        <p>With proper care and maintenance, veneers can last 10 to 15 years or even longer. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene, such as brushing, flossing, and keeping a hygiene appointment every 4-6 months, are essential for their longevity. It is also important to treat veneers with care, avoiding habits like biting on hard objects or using teeth as tools, which can potentially damage them. With proper care, you maximize the longevity and value of your investment.</p>\n        <p>Are veneers a good option for everyone?</p>\n        <p>Veneers are suitable for many, many people and in many cases. However, a comprehensive dental evaluation is necessary to determine their suitability for your specific needs. Factors such as tooth and gum health, bite alignment, and overall oral condition should be assessed to ensure that veneers are a viable option for you.</p>\n        <p>Can veneers fix all types of dental imperfections?</p>\n        <p>Veneers are highly versatile and can address a wide range of cosmetic issues, but not all dental imperfections. Veneers are effective in concealing dental imperfections such as chipped, oddly shaped, crooked, or discolored teeth. However, severe misalignment or extensive tooth damage may require alternative treatments like orthodontics or dental crowns. A highly-trained and experienced cosmetic dentist can determine the most appropriate solution for your unique situation.</p>\n        <p>How much do veneers cost?</p>\n        <p>The cost of veneers varies based on factors such as material and the number of teeth being treated. While high-quality veneers and crowns require an upfront investment of around $2,000-2,500 per tooth, their long-lasting aesthetic benefits often make them a worthwhile investment. It is important to discuss the cost and payment options with your insurance provider and dentist.</p>\n        <p>Are veneers worth the cost?</p>\n        <p>Investing in dental veneers can provide you with a fast and dramatic change, resulting in the beautiful and confident smile of your dreams. While the cost of custom-made veneers may require a considerable investment, the long-term benefits and the boost in confidence, they provide make them valuable for your oral health and overall well-being. Whether you’re an actor, a model, or a professional who is constantly seen in meetings and presentations — an investment in your smile is an investment in your earnings potential.</p>\n        <p>Exquisite Results At Exquisite Dentistry, our veneers are crafted from the highest quality porcelain, yielding the thinnest possible surface and minimizing the reduction in natural tooth structure. Dr. Aguil’s expertise as a cosmetic dentist and veneer expert ensures that veneers are tailored to each patient–and each tooth–yielding the most natural-looking and beautiful results.</p>\n        <p>With dental veneers, you can transform your appearance, boost your self-esteem, and enjoy the benefits of a beautiful smile for years to come.

Book a consultation. We will scan your teeth, share a 3D preview of your new smile, and design a plan that balances comfort, timing, and budget.</p>\n        <h2>Invisalign</h2>\n        <p>has revolutionized orthodontic treatment with its stunning results and discreet and convenient approach. As the leading teeth straightening system, Invisalign can deliver a gorgeous smile for adults and teens seeking either small aesthetic changes or major structural improvements.</p>\n        <p>At Exquisite Dentistry, under the expert guidance of Dr. Aguil, a GoldPlus Invisalign provider, Invisalign is at the pinnacle of teeth-aligning technology . In this article, Dr. Aguil addresses some common questions regarding Invisalign as an investment and sheds light on its numerous benefits.</p>\n        <p>What is Invisalign and how does it work?</p>\n        <p>Invisalign is a modern orthodontic treatment that utilizes clear aligners to gradually shift teeth into their desired position. The aligners are custom-made and virtually invisible, making them a highly attractive alternative to traditional braces, especially for adults. The treatment process involves a series of aligners, each used for approximately 1 to 2  weeks, providing an easy and comfortable teeth straightening experience.</p>\n        <p>Is Invisalign worth the investment compared to other aligners and braces?</p>\n        <p>Absolutely. While there are other aligner brands on the market, Invisalign has been leading the way for 30 years and is unmatched in experience and effectiveness. Invisalign also offers a host of advantages over traditional braces, including its virtually undetectable appearance and removability,  allowing for easier oral hygiene maintenance. With Invisalign, patients experience greater comfort, convenience, and confidence throughout the treatment process.</p>\n        <p>How long does the Invisalign treatment typically take?</p>\n        <p>The duration of Invisalign treatment varies depending on individual cases, but technological advancements, that only invisalign can provide, as well as starting early and before problems worsen, have led to shorter treatment times. At Exquisite Dentistry we generally quote a range of 6 to 12 months, though it is quite common to achieve faster results due to Invisalign’s advanced techniques and technology. Exquisite Dentistry patients also have the option for accelerators, which can produce results in as little as 3 months.</p>\n        <p>Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations to Invisalign?</p>\n        <p>Invisalign is highly effective for most orthodontia. That said, it is essential for patients to wear the aligners consistently and take proper care of them to achieve successful results in the shortest time. Complex orthodontic issues may require alternative treatments; a top-rated Invisalign dentist can advise you on whether Invisalign is ideal for your particular case.</p>\n        <p>What is the cost of Invisalign treatment?</p>\n        <p>The cost of Invisalign can vary depending on the complexity of the case. Many dental insurance plans provide coverage for Invisalign treatment under standard orthodontic benefits (see more about that below). In addition, at Exquisite Dentistry, we understand that cost can be a concern for some patients; therefore we offer flexible payment options and no-fee financing plans to make Invisalign–and a beautiful healthy smile–more accessible.</p>\n        <p>Does insurance cover Invisalign?</p>\n        <p>In many cases, Invisalign treatment is covered by standard orthodontic insurance benefits. Dental insurance plans that provide coverage for traditional braces often extend the same coverage to Invisalign. However, it’s important to review the specifics of your insurance policy to determine the extent of coverage. At Exquisite Dentistry, we work closely with our patients to maximize their insurance benefits and offer guidance on navigating the insurance process. Our team is dedicated to helping you achieve your desired smile while making payment as easy as possible.</p>\n        <p>What is the cost of doing nothing – can it lead to expensive dental problems down the road?</p>\n        <p>Misaligned teeth can exert pressures that degrade tooth, gum, and bone health over time. The resulting issues, such as cracks, infections, and root problems, often necessitate costly dental work like root canals and crowns.</p>\n        <p>By investing in Invisalign, you are proactively preventing these dental problems and maintaining the overall health of your teeth. A $5,000 investment in Invisalign is a relatively small price to pay compared to the cost of extensive dental work later in life. Additionally, straighter teeth are easier to keep clean, reducing the risk of gum disease and contributing to a healthier mouth and body.</p>\n        <p>What makes Invisalign worth it?</p>\n        <p>Invisalign and a gorgeously aligned smile provide an opportunity to improve your oral health, enhance your appearance, and unlock your career-earning potential. With Invisalign, you can embrace the modern way of straightening your teeth, while enjoying the benefits of a comfortable, discreet, and effective treatment.</p>\n        <h2>The Exquisite Difference</h2>\n        <p>Invisalign is undoubtedly a sound investment for those seeking a beautiful, confident smile and improved oral health. With its advanced technology, shorter treatment times, and the expertise of Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry , you can achieve the smile you’ve always desired.</p>\n        <p>Schedule a consultation with us today and discover why Exquisite Dentistry is consistently ranked as the #1 Invisalign provider in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Your journey to a radiant smile starts here.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Veneers and dental implants both improve your smile, but they serve different purposes. Veneers cover the front of healthy teeth to enhance color, shape, and alignment. Implants replace an entire tooth—including the root—when a tooth is missing or beyond repair.</p>\n        <p>Choose veneers when you want to refresh stained enamel, close gaps, or smooth chips. The process takes about three visits: digital planning, a preparation appointment with temporary veneers, and final bonding of custom porcelain shells. Results are immediate and dramatic.</p>\n        <p>Implants are the preferred solution for missing teeth. A titanium post is placed in the jawbone, allowed to heal, and then topped with a custom crown. The timeline is longer, but the result looks and functions like a natural tooth while protecting your bone and preserving your bite.</p>\n        <p>Sometimes we combine both treatments—using implants to fill gaps and veneers to perfect the remaining teeth—for a balanced makeover. During your consultation we will evaluate your oral health, discuss your goals, and map out a personalized plan so you can choose the path that keeps your smile strong and stunning.</p>\n        <h2>Choosing Veneers or Implants for Your Teeth</h2>\n        <p>When it comes to veneers or implants, both options offer a life-changing transformative solution that can significantly enhance your smile, confidence, and overall dental health.</p>\n        <p>Porcelain veneers are thin, durable shells of high-quality porcelain placed over the teeth to effectively mask imperfections such as chips, stains, or gaps. They offer a fast and minimally invasive solution to enhancing the appearance of your smile and provide immediate results with minimal discomfort. Occasionally, veneers are used in conjunction with dental implants to replace missing or badly damaged teeth.</p>\n        <p>Implants are titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone to replace missing teeth. This option offers a permanent solution that looks, feels, and functions just like natural teeth. Implants restore your smile’s appearance, help preserve jawbone integrity, and prevent dental issues associated with tooth loss.</p>\n        <p>When deciding between veneers or implants, factors such as the condition of your teeth, your oral health, and your desired outcome should be considered.</p>\n        <p>At Exquisite Dentistry in LA, cosmetic dentist Dr. Alexie Aguil is highly skilled in porcelain veneers and dental implants, the optimal use of each, and how to effectively use them together. With years of experience and a dedication to providing exceptional care, Dr. Aguil will answer all your questions and guide you through a treatment plan that is ideal for your case and personal goals.</p>\n        <h2>What are Dental Veneers?</h2>\n        <p>Porcelain veneers can address various issues that often prevent people from feeling confident about their smiles. Veneers offer a long-lasting solution, effectively correcting cracks, chips, and tooth coloration. Moreover, veneers can straighten crooked teeth and fill gaps between teeth for a fully comprehensive transformation. With their natural appearance and durable quality, porcelain veneers enhance the aesthetics of your smile, boost your self-esteem, and allow you to smile confidently.</p>\n        <p>Partnering with one of the finest dental laboratories in the US, Dr. Aguil crafts each veneer out of the highest quality porcelain to create a natural smile. The treatment process typically takes place over several visits: Initial Consultation: Dr. Aguil starts with a complete exam and cleaning . Then, using our advanced iTero 3D Scanner, he takes a comprehensive digital map of your mouth. Together, you discuss options, including the shape and color of your veneers. Our technology will show you what your smile will look like before you start! Similar to a haircut, it can be helpful to bring in a photo of your ideal smile to guide the discussion with a visual reference. Dr. Aguil will work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that aligns with your aesthetic goals.</p>\n        <p>Follow-Up Visit: Before your final veneers are created, Dr. Aguil will place temporary veneers over your teeth, carefully shaping individual teeth to create the best surface to help each veneer hold securely. He’ll then place the temporary veneers on top of the teeth. These temporary veneers are a model of the final veneers.</p>\n        <p>You’ll notice the transformation immediately, but Dr. Aguil wants you to love them 100% and for the long term, which is why he insists on a try-in period. During the try-in period, you will communicate with him about what you like best about the temporary veneers and what you’d like to change—from color and shape to comfort and your speaking ability.</p>\n        <p>Final Visit: During this visit, your temporary veneers are removed, and the custom-made veneers are securely bonded in place. With your new veneers in place, you’re all set to enjoy years of beautiful smiles. Just like that, your smile is transformed. This seamless process is why many patients choose veneers to enhance their smiles and confidence.</p>\n        <h2>What are Implants?</h2>\n        <p>Dental implants are artificial roots made of titanium that replace the structure of the missing tooth. Dr. Aguil may recommend dental implants to replace teeth and fix issues related to tooth loss or damage. It’s important to note that all dentists can place implants, but since Dr. Aguil does not, he makes sure to partner with highly skilled specialists near our West Hollywood office to perform the procedure. Depending on the case, Dr. Aguil may suggest a different treatment, like a dental bridge , which anchors to the teeth on either side. Dental implants offer a stronger and more permanent solution for tooth loss.</p>\n        <p>Though the results are equally beautiful for veneers and implants, the implant process is quite different and can take a few months to complete: Initial Consultation: Should Dr. Aguil determine that implants are the right course of treatment for you, he will refer you to our long-time specialists, who will perform their own examination.</p>\n        <h2>Preparation:</h2>\n        <p>The specialists will prepare your mouth by gently cutting back your gums and inserting a custom-made artificial tooth root into your jawbone. After a few months, your gums will completely heal, allowing for osseointegration, where the jawbone fuses to the implant. Similar to the veneer process, Dr. Aguil works closely with the dental laboratory to guide the implant crown creation. The added layer of quality control ensures that the crown fits the shape, color, and size of your natural teeth.</p>\n        <p>Implant Placement: Once your titanium root is in place and healed, you’ll prepare for your final implant restoration. Dr. Aguil will gently remove the healing cap and make the proper measurements to ensure that your replacement fits exactly as it should. Then, your newly crafted crown will be affixed to the implant. When the process is complete, your smile will be happy and healthy once again.</p>\n        <p>While anesthetic is unnecessary, the treatment itself is done with your absolute comfort in mind. Local anesthetic or gentle sedation options are available at your request. Your jaw may be sore for as long as a few months following your implant, which is easily managed with over-the-counter medication.</p>\n        <h2>How Veneers and Implants Work Together to Create Your Perfect Smile</h2>\n        <p>While veneers are a popular choice for enhancing the appearance of existing teeth, they are not suitable in cases where a tooth is missing. In such instances, dental implants emerge as a viable alternative, offering a durable and aesthetically pleasing solution for tooth replacement. However, it’s crucial to note that the integration of an implant into the jawbone requires a healing period that can span several months, making it a more time-intensive option compared to other treatments like bridges, which can quickly address gaps left by missing teeth.</p>\n        <p>During consultations, patients often inquire about implants, though these discussions typically revolve around concerns such as replacing missing teeth, rectifying issues with damaged teeth, or updating old crowns, rather than as part of a veneer application. This distinction underscores the importance of tailoring treatment recommendations to the specific needs and circumstances of each patient, ensuring that all options are considered in the context of achieving a harmonious and functional veneer smile makeover.</p>\n        <p>If you’re missing a tooth or need to restore dental function, your primary options typically involve a dental implant or a dental bridge . Each option serves a distinct purpose, and Dr. Aguil can determine the most appropriate treatment based on your specific needs and goals.</p>\n        <h2>Exquisite Dentistry: Los Angeles’ Choice for Veneers and Implants</h2>\n        <p>If you’re considering veneers or implants, Exquisite Dentistry is the premier destination in LA for all your dental needs.

During your consultation we will assess your goals and oral health, then recommend the path—or mix of treatments—that delivers the strongest, most natural-looking results.</p>\n        <p>Should you choose dental veneers or braces to shape your teeth and align your bite? This is ultimately a discussion to have between you and your dentist, but it always helps to prepare yourself with information.</p>\n        <p>If you live in the area of Los Angeles, California, then Dr. Alexie Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry can help you determine the best treatment for a radiant smile. And even if not, we’d be happy to share our insights to help you learn more and decide together with a dentist near you.</p>\n        <h2>What are Dental Veneers?</h2>\n        <p>Dental veneers are a thin material that a dentist can adhere to teeth for restoring damage, adjusting their shape, and improving their overall look. The highest quality porcelain veneers applied by a skilled cosmetic dentist will look and feel natural.</p>\n        <h2>What are Dental Braces?</h2>\n        <p>Dental braces are devices that gently push and reposition teeth over time. Traditional metallic braces are kept in the mouth and readjusted (tightened) until the right alignment is reached.</p>\n        <p>Invisalign treatment is a popular alternative to metallic braces. Invisalign uses a series of clear aligners that can be removed when you eat, or for other activities. But even when you take photos, you probably won’t even see them. That’s the beauty of Invisalign.</p>\n        <h2>A Complete Change to Bite Registration</h2>\n        <p>Both of these treatments may completely change the alignment of your teeth and the shape of your bite. This makes them both effective at treating misaligned teeth and closing gaps between teeth. But there are a few benefits to one or the other depending on the results you’re looking for.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>The Benefits of Dental Veneers vs. Braces</h2>\n        <p>In addition to aligning your teeth, porcelain veneers are an excellent treatment for enhancing their overall appearance. When treatment is done through a top cosmetic dentist , such as here at Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles, the advanced ceramic materials will give you the look and feel of natural teeth.</p>\n        <p>Additionally, dental veneers can be used to adjust the actual shape of the teeth themselves, not just their alignment or position in your mouth.</p>\n        <p>The process for dental veneers typically takes 3-4 trips to the dentist. You can see the desired results much more quickly than with braces in as little as a couple weeks.</p>\n        <h2>The Benefits of Dental Braces vs. Veneers</h2>\n        <p>Dental braces or Invisalign treatments are best used for substantial alignment or spacing issues. Patients have teeth that don’t line up properly at all and can even be experiencing discomfort in their mouth or jaw. This misalignment of teeth (called malocclusion) can lead to wear and tear on your teeth, gums and even bone that isn’t normal and can lead to worse issues down the line.</p>\n        <p>The Invisalign system incorporates a series of high definition 3D aligners, each custom-made for the patient, that shift teeth to the desired position with each step forward throughout the series. Before you even have to wear your first aligner, you’ll get to view your final smile using our advanced iTero scanner right in Dr. Aguil’s office. It only takes a few minutes to scan your mouth, then create a 3D movie of what the end results will look like.</p>\n        <h2>With You From Start to Finish</h2>\n        <p>The best way to determine what to choose between veneers vs. braces is to schedule an appointment with Exquisite Dentistry . In your first consultation, we’ll analyze your smile and bite, and then find the best steps to get them where you want them to be.</p>\n        <p>A consultation with Dr. Aguil is the first step to getting the smile you’ve always wanted. He will look at the health of your teeth and determine the best course of treatment based on your individual desires. With your final goal in mind, he will break down the best way to achieve it—be it with porcelain veneers or Invisalign braces.</p>\n        <p>Invisalign can be used to align your smile, but veneers may also be added after treatment for certain issues that braces cannot resolve, such as discoloration of the natural teeth. Dr. Aguil can use veneers to reshape and therefore change your bite into the natural position that Invislign would. However, using veneers, he can also create the best elements of a Hollywood smile.</p>\n        <p>The discussion of “veneers vs. braces” can instead become “veneers OR braces” or even “veneers AND braces,” depending on your needs.</p>\n        <h2>Feel Comfortable in Our Care</h2>\n        <p>Exquisite Dentistry in West Los Angeles is the premier place to maintain a healthy mouth and bring out your best smile.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Veneers and Invisalign both create beautiful smiles, but they solve different problems. Veneers cover the front of teeth to change their appearance, while Invisalign aligners gently move teeth into better positions.</p>\n        <p>Choose veneers when the main goal is to refresh shape, size, or color. Porcelain shells can smooth chips, close small gaps, and brighten stains in just a few visits. They are ideal when your bite already feels comfortable and you want instant cosmetic results.</p>\n        <p>Opt for Invisalign if your teeth are crowded, spaced, or misaligned. The clear aligners gradually shift teeth without brackets or wires, making it easier to brush, floss, and eat your favorite foods during treatment. Most adults finish in 6–12 months, and the trays are nearly invisible.</p>\n        <p>Sometimes treatment combines both options—using Invisalign to align the bite and veneers to fine-tune shape or color afterward. During your consultation we evaluate your teeth, discuss your goals, and design a plan that gives you the smile you envision.</p>\n        <p>Dental veneers and Invisalign are two of the most effective treatments for getting your ideal smile.</p>\n        <h2>Veneers</h2>\n        <p>are sections of porcelain bonded to the teeth to enhance their color and shape.</p>\n        <p>Invisalign treatment is a series of removable clear aligners that shift teeth into place much quicker than braces.</p>\n        <p>Both treatments are viable for enhancing the shape and spacing of your teeth.</p>\n        <p>When a patient comes to us with concerns about the shape of their teeth, we take their apprehension extremely seriously. Teeth that are misaligned, misshapen, or that have gaps between them are troublesome for a couple of different reasons: Cosmetic concerns: When teeth are not positioned appropriately in the mouth, it detracts from your smile and your confidence. Whether you’re trying to earn a promotion, stand out during your next casting call, or simply dazzle while you’re out on the town, the importance of a great smile can’t be overstated.</p>\n        <p>Oral health concerns: The shape of your teeth plays an important part in your oral health. Teeth that are misshapen, pitted, or with gaps between them can be difficult to brush effectively. Over time, this can cause a host of issues like gingivitis, cavities, or even infection.</p>\n        <p>If you are looking to shape your teeth, Dr. Alexie Aguil often recommends one of two treatment options: veneers or Invisalign. We’re often asked about the benefits of veneers vs. Invisalign when dealing with misshapen teeth. Both are excellent options, and each has its pros and cons, depending on your situation.</p>\n        <h2>What Are Veneers?</h2>\n        <p>To understand the benefits of veneers vs. Invisalign, it’s helpful to know a bit more about each of them.</p>\n        <p>Porcelain veneers have become an extremely popular way to dramatically change the look of teeth very quickly. In as few as three visits, a dentist can have veneers crafted and permanently bonded to your teeth. These porcelain caps can last 10 years or longer, giving your smile a new lease on life. Consider these key points for the best results: Choose a dentist who uses high-quality materials.</p>\n        <p>Like most things in life, you get what you pay for. You can typically spot low-grade veneers by their opaque plastic look. Dr. Aguil uses only the highest-quality medical-grade porcelain for his veneers. Additionally, he works closely with one of the most well-regarded dental labs on the West Coast as they craft your veneers, ensuring they will provide a perfect fit and the best smile you’ve ever had.</p>\n        <p>Choose a dentist who uses state-of-the-art equipment.</p>\n        <p>Measuring teeth for the best fit takes the most advanced technology . At Exquisite, our diagnostic tools will guarantee your veneers fit naturally over your existing teeth.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>What Is Invisalign?</h2>\n        <p>For those curious about the differences between veneers vs. Invisalign, a look at Invisalign is also in order. These clear plastic aligners have exploded in popularity over the past ten years or so. They fit snugly over teeth and gently shift them to their appropriate positions over time. They’ve become the best alternative to traditional metal braces for several reasons: Ease of use: Metal braces come with a host of eating restrictions. If you eat the wrong types of foods, you can pop a bracket or wire, requiring an unplanned trip to the dentist’s office. Because Invisalign trays can be taken in and out, you’ll never have to worry about mealtime restrictions again.</p>\n        <h2>Comfort:</h2>\n        <p>Traditional braces often cause discomfort when they’re tightened or when brackets rub against the cheek. Invisalign trays are smooth and fit right over the teeth, so there’s little pain involved during the entire treatment period.</p>\n        <h2>Appearance:</h2>\n        <p>Most people don’t like how traditional braces fill their mouths with metal and wire, so the idea of a tooth-straightening system that is virtually invisible is very appealing.</p>\n        <h2>Veneers vs. Invisalign: Which Is Superior?</h2>\n        <p>It’s easy to see why both veneers and Invisalign are attractive choices for many who want to shape their teeth. Dr. Aguil offers both options at Exquisite Dental, and he has patients who have been extremely satisfied with both.</p>\n        <p>However, the question remains, “Which is superior when considering veneers vs. Invisalign?” The answer to that question isn’t as simple as you think. Would you be able to answer the question, “Which is better, a hammer or a saw?” Of course not! They’re both tools that are appropriate for certain applications. The need dictates which tool is used.</p>\n        <p>The same is true when considering veneers vs. Invisalign. Both are tools that are perfect in certain situations. Each option has its strengths and weaknesses. Veneers are a great option when reshaping chipped, cracked, or discolored teeth. Invisalign is a perfect choice when you have teeth with great shape and color that only need to be shifted to their correct position.</p>\n        <p>The best way to know which option is better for your unique situation is to schedule an appointment with Exquisite so that Dr. Aguil can give you a consultation. After a thorough cleaning and exam , he’ll go over your choices and give you a recommended course of treatment. During your consultation, Dr Aguil will create a digital map of your teeth using the iTero 5D scanner. Within minutes, he will show you the best position for your teeth and discover any other issues that may need to be addressed.</p>\n        <h2>Choose Exquisite Dentistry to Shape Your Teeth</h2>\n        <p>Before you decide between veneers vs. Invisalign, you need to make sure you select the dentist who will give you the best results.</p>\n        <p>If you live in the Los Angeles area, start with Exquisite Dentistry.

Schedule a whitening consultation at our West Hollywood dental spa. We will keep you comfortable with cozy blankets, headphones, and thoughtful care while we refresh your teeth.</p>\n        <p>Everyone wants a beautiful Hollywood smile. There are plenty of at-home remedies, but they’re often ineffective toothpastes, messy trays, or sloppy bleach gels that just don’t give the best results.</p>\n        <p>If you want your teeth to lighten by several shades, teeth whitening at the dentist’s office is your best choice. A skilled dentist can help you quickly and safely brighten your smile. There are several ways that a dentist may whiten your teeth, and your dentist will work with you to tailor your treatment to get the results you’re looking for.</p>\n        <h2>How a Dentist Can Whiten Your Teeth</h2>\n        <h2>Here at Exquisite Dentistry of Los Angeles,</h2>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n        <p>has been transforming smiles for years. If you visit his dentist’s office for teeth whitening, he’ll typically recommend one of three treatment options.</p>\n        <h2>Zoom! Advanced Teeth Whitening</h2>\n        <p>Zoom! Whitening is advanced laser teeth whitening that delivers the quickest and most noticeable results of any whitening method. The best teeth-whitening dentists choose Zoom as their preferred treatment method.</p>\n        <p>Here’s how it works. First, your teeth will be thoroughly cleaned to remove tartar buildup and maximize the teeth whitening effects. A whitening gel will be applied to your teeth. Then, your dentist will shine the Zoom! Light on your teeth to remove stains and discoloration.</p>\n        <p>The entire process takes about 60 minutes and safely brightens even the most sensitive of teeth. Zoom! Advanced teeth whitening treatment is how a dentist can whiten your teeth by up to 8 shades in a single visit!</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <p>Porcelain Veneers In situations where patients are looking to make more significant cosmetic changes to their smile, Dr. Aguil may recommend porcelain veneers . These thin, translucent porcelain pieces create the natural look of bright white teeth while helping to repair damage, and giving them the ideal shape.</p>\n        <p>Porcelain veneers typically require three visits to the dentist for teeth whitening: Visit one: Dr. Aguil will consult with you about your goals for your smile. If you’d like to move forward with veneers, he’ll make a digital impression of your teeth. He’ll send these measurements to one of the most prestigious dental ceramists on the West Coast. Together, they’ll begin to hand craft your veneers.</p>\n        <p>Visit two: Temporary veneers are placed over your treated teeth. These short-term coverings will help determine the ideal fit and feel you’re looking for. Changes to the final veneers can be made during this “try-in” period to assure that your smile design will be the smile that works best for you.</p>\n        <p>Visit three: The temporary veneers are removed and the finished porcelain veneers are securely bonded to your teeth.</p>\n        <p>Veneers will often last ten years or more with proper care. During your next dentist visit,  Dr. Aguil can consult with you about whether you’re a good candidate for high-quality porcelain veneers, as well as use advanced technology to show you what your smile will look like when treatment is complete.</p>\n        <h2>General Teeth Cleaning &amp; Care</h2>\n        <p>When was the last time you had your semi-annual cleaning ? Before recommending other treatments, Your teeth will be cleaned with state-of-the-art methods and technology. Many patients find that this cleaning will help gently remove light stains on their teeth, especially if they haven’t kept up twice-yearly dentist visits.</p>\n        <p>At your cleaning, a dental hygienist will gently sweep away plaque and tartar that have built up on your teeth over time. In just a few minutes, you’ll achieve a brighter, healthier smile! Even if you’ve already decided on laser whitening, regular cleaning and care are how a dentist can whiten your teeth and keep them that way.</p>\n        <h2>Dentist Teeth Whitening At Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n        <p>If you live in the greater Los Angeles area, you’ll want to visit Exquisite Dentistry for your teeth whitening.

We will review your goals, recommend the safest approach, and set you up with a plan that fits your lifestyle.</p>\n        <p>You want your smile to dazzle—in person and in photos. So when your pearly whites begin to lose their shine, you need a whitening solution that’s convenient, safe, and effective. With multiple popular teeth-whitening options on the market, you want to make sure you choose the best solution for your long-term beauty and wellness.</p>\n        <p>Before choosing a treatment, it is important to discuss whitening options with your dentist—especially if you’ve had dental work done. Whitening only affects your actual teeth, so your smile may lose its natural look if you have crowns, bridges, or fillings. Your dentist will also be able to predict how your teeth will react to treatment, based on your age, the strength of your enamel, and other factors.</p>\n        <p>Over-the-Counter Solutions Those looking for easy ways to whiten your teeth may immediately think about teeth-whitening kits you can find at the store. Whitening strips and trays bought at drugstores and other retailers may make your teeth look whiter in as little as two weeks, but they only reduce surface stains—often with inconsistent, short-lived results.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <p>Since over-the-counter whiteners are considered cosmetic products, they are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Common complaints and side effects include gum irritation and a temporary increase in tooth sensitivity. If you already have sensitive teeth or if you’ve had plenty of dental work in the past, OTC products may not be the best solution for you. In short, while kits may be an easy teeth whitening method, it’s also the least effective and most risky.</p>\n        <h2>Dentist-Supervised, At-Home Bleaching</h2>\n        <p>While most whitening strips only cover portions of your smile, custom-made bleaching trays can whiten all of your teeth. Your dentist can fit you with a tray—which reduces the risk of bleach contacting your gums, in turn lowering your risk of gum irritation.</p>\n        <p>This method is supervised by your dentist, so they can monitor how your teeth and gums react to treatment, and adjust the concentration of bleach accordingly. You may notice results in about two weeks if you perform the technique daily.</p>\n        <h2>In-office Teeth Whitening</h2>\n        <p>If you’re looking for an easy way to whiten your teeth, the first two options are time-consuming and messy. The easiest teeth whitening method is to have your teeth whitened at your dentist’s office.</p>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n        <p>at Exquisite Dentistry utilizes the Zoom Advanced teeth whitening system to produce the fastest, longest-lasting results.

His precision and skill will give you the best possible outcome for the situation.</p>\n        <p>Dr. Aguil answers questions about chipped teeth on a regular basis.

How Bad Is It?”</h2>\n        <p>The first question Dr. Aguil usually fields from concerned patients is about the extent of the damage to the tooth. Because tooth damage occurs for a variety of reasons, there are several types of injuries to look out for.</p>\n        <p>Craze lines are minor surface cracks that develop on the enamel of your tooth, which may not require treatment. This is the best-case scenario in dealing with a cracked or chipped tooth.</p>\n        <p>Broken cusps involve damage to the chewing surface of your teeth. Though not painful, these injuries may require reshaping and crowns .</p>\n        <p>Minor chips are usually not too painful but may need to be repaired with polishing and/or filling.</p>\n        <h2>A</h2>\n        <p>cracked tooth consists of damage to your whole tooth—from the enamel to the root. If left untreated, the crack can worsen over time and become a split tooth. The crack may also be harboring bacteria that can lead to cavities—potentially infecting the root and leading to more extensive treatments, such as root canal therapy and a dental crown.</p>\n        <h2>Cavities</h2>\n        <p>can weaken your teeth, resulting in decay-induced breaks. Following the recommendation of your dentist and hygienist, we can detect cavities before extensive treatments are needed. This is the best way to avoid cavities is to ensure you are keeping your semi-annual dental cleaning appointments.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>“I Chipped My Tooth.

If it’s a dental emergency , they may be able to fit you in sooner. In the meantime, follow these simple instructions if you’re still not sure what to do with your chipped tooth: Clean out your mouth with lukewarm water. Water that is too hot or too cold could cause significant pain to any exposed nerves in the pulp of the cracked tooth.</p>\n        <p>If you notice bleeding as a result of a damaged tooth, apply pressure to the injured area using clean gauze. Maintain gentle pressure until the bleeding has subsided.</p>\n        <p>Protect the affected tooth until your upcoming dentist appointment. Dental cement is an effective temporary solution and can be found at most drugstores or big-box retailers like Target or Walmart. Orajel can topically dull the pain of a chipped or cracked tooth, but you should use any type of medication with caution. Check with your dentist before using any over-the-counter dental products.</p>\n        <p>If the damage causes pain that a topical medication cannot alleviate, take an over-the-counter pain reliever like Tylenol or Advil. Be sure to follow instructions carefully to take the proper dosage.</p>\n        <p>Eat only soft foods and avoid using the chipped tooth to chew.</p>\n        <h2>“I Chipped My Tooth. What Will the Dentist Do?”</h2>\n        <p>Your treatment will depend on the severity of your injury. For a minor chip, the dentist may polish the affected tooth to make its surface smoother and less likely to cut the inside of your mouth. For extensive damage—when your tooth’s nerve is exposed, for example—the dentist may recommend a root canal and a crown to replace the broken tooth. The only way a dentist will know what to do with a chipped tooth is by viewing the tooth and possibly taking X-rays of the affected area.</p>\n        <p>For many chipped teeth, your dentist will use a veneer or crown to restore your smile’s natural beauty—and to protect inner layers from further damage, including infection. Following treatment, it is important to maintain a consistent routine of brushing and flossing, and regular visits to your dentist.</p>\n        <h2>“I Chipped My Tooth? Where Should I Go?”</h2>\n        <p>Because chipped and cracked teeth can vary so widely, you need to make sure that you choose a dentist that knows what to do with any type of chipped tooth. Your oral care is too important to trust to just any dentist. You need a dentist who has the best technology , skill set, and team in place to handle your situation.</p>\n        <p>If you live in Los Angeles, you can’t make a better choice than Exquisite Dentistry.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <p>Smoking exposes your mouth to chemicals that irritate cells, and over time those changes can lead to oral cancer. Recent research shows women who smoke face a higher risk than men, making regular screenings and healthy habits especially important.</p>\n        <p>Tobacco smoke, chewing tobacco, and even vaping introduce carcinogens that dry the mouth and damage gum tissue. When saliva decreases, bacteria thrive and precancerous spots can develop more easily. HPV infections and heavy alcohol use can compound that risk.</p>\n        <p>Watch for symptoms such as sores that do not heal, red or white patches, persistent soreness, or changes in the way your teeth fit together. These signs do not always mean cancer, but they do require a prompt dental exam.</p>\n        <p>If you smoke, we can connect you with quit resources and create a monitoring plan that includes annual oral cancer screenings. Early detection saves tissue, limits surgery, and protects your overall health. Call our office to schedule a screening and take the next step toward a healthier smile.</p>\n        <h2>Understanding the Link: Female Smokers and the High Risk of Oral Cancer</h2>\n        <p>Your smile is often one of the first things people notice. Whether you’re laughing, posing for a photo, or simply brimming with joy, a radiant smile speaks volumes. For women, it’s not just about aesthetics; it’s a powerful expression of happiness, health, and confidence that resonates with others. However, behind this outward expression lies a hidden risk to women’s health that is more prevalent than previously believed. A recent study reports that “female smokers have a higher risk [of oral cancer] than males.” In light of this high risk of oral cancer, particularly for female smokers, it’s imperative to understand the facts and take proactive measures to safeguard your health.</p>\n        <h2>The Risks of Smoking</h2>\n        <p>Let’s start with the obvious culprit: tobacco. The unsettling truth is the risk for oral cancer is ten times higher for smokers compared to nonsmokers—regardless of gender. Beyond oral cancer, smoking also increases the risk of gum disease and tooth loss . It’s important to note that these risks don’t just stop with cigarettes. Smokeless tobacco, also known as chewing tobacco or snuff, contains at least 28 carcinogens and can lead to a range of oral health issues, including gum disease, tooth decay, and tooth loss.</p>\n        <p>Additionally, it can cause the formation of white or gray patches inside the mouth, known as leukoplakia, that can progress to cancer. E-cigarettes or vapes, while still relatively new to the scene, are also harmful. Despite being marketed as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, they still pose significant risks to oral health. These devices contain nicotine, which can restrict blood flow to the gums and lead to an increased risk of gum disease .</p>\n        <p>The chemicals present in e-cigarettes can irritate gum tissues and contribute to inflammation and other oral health issues . According to the CDC , e-cigarette aerosols contain harmful substances such as nicotine, heavy metals like lead, and volatile organic compounds, all of which can have detrimental effects on oral tissues when inhaled. Formaldehyde, another known component of e-cigarettes, is a recognized carcinogen that can cause cellular damage and inflammation in the oral cavity.</p>\n        <h2>Acrolein</h2>\n        <p>, a highly reactive chemical used in herbicides, is often found in e-cigarettes and can irritate the mucous membranes in the mouth and throat, potentially leading to conditions such as dry mouth, chronic inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer.</p>\n        <p>Especially for female smokers, it’s crucial to recognize that all forms of tobacco use, including smoking, smokeless tobacco, and vaping, have detrimental effects on oral health. Taking steps toward quitting the habit can be the first line of defense in protecting your oral and overall wellness.</p>\n        <h2>HPV and Oral Cancer</h2>\n        <p>While traditionally associated with cervical cancer, studies from the CDC have shown a strong association between Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and oral cancer. This association is particularly concerning for female smokers, who face heightened risks. Viruses and fungi contracted from tobacco used by smokers are often identified as triggers for oral cancer, with areas of the mouth associated with HPV directly linked to the onset and progression of the disease.</p>\n        <h2>Oral Cancer Screenings and Preventative Care</h2>\n        <p>Oral cancer can manifest in various ways, typically occurring in areas such as the throat, cheeks, gums, and lips. However, tumors can also develop in less commonly recognized locations like the floor of the mouth, buccal mucosa (the lining of the cheeks and the back of the lips, inside the mouth where they touch the teeth), and mucosal surface of the lip (the “wet” part of the lip that touches the teeth).</p>\n        <p>Oral cancer has also been detected in regions like the retromolar triangle (the triangular area located after the last molar), hard palate (which separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavities), alveolus (the minute air sacs at the end of the tiny branches of air tubes in the lungs), and anterior two-thirds of the tongue.</p>\n        <p>Given the complexity of these potential sites and the high risk of oral cancer facing female smokers, it’s important to talk to your dentist about getting a screening for oral cancer . Without annual screenings (like for a mammogram) oral cancer isn’t seen until it’s in its latest stages. At this stage, significant removal of tissue is often required often resulting in severely disfiguring surgeries of the face and neck. This proactive step can help detect abnormalities early on for timely intervention.</p>\n        <h2>Prioritize Healthy Choices</h2>\n        <p>You can also help to decrease the risk of oral cancer by prioritizing healthy choices and overall well-being. Maintaining a balanced lifestyle, including a nutritious diet, regular exercise, proper hydration, and sufficient sleep, is essential for keeping the body strong and disease-free.</p>\n        <p>Studies show that people who exercise regularly are 54% less likely to develop periodontitis compared to those who do not exercise.</p>\n        <p>Practices like meditation and deep breathing are linked to improved mental health, reduced stress levels, and enhanced cognitive function. Most of all, it’s essential to steer clear of harmful substances like tobacco, excessive alcohol, and illicit drugs for a healthier mouth—and life.</p>\n        <h2>Early Detection Makes for a Great Start</h2>\n        <p>It’s important to note that while female smokers are at a higher risk, all genders that smoke or use tobacco products are at a high risk of oral cancer. “Knowledge is power,” and nothing puts you in control of your health like learning the honest facts. Early detection not only allows you to know your status early on but also enables you to seek treatment before an issue worsens.</p>\n        <p>Empower yourself with the tools to learn the recommended methods of tobacco reduction and how to prevent oral cancer from spreading, get referrals for HPV screenings, and look to a trusted and experienced dentist to identify the signs of oral cancer. After all, great oral health goes beyond a beautiful smile.</p>\n        <p>If you feel you are at risk for oral cancer, it’s time to get proactive about your health.</p>\n        <p>Contact us today for your annual oral cancer screening consultation.</p>\n      </div>",

Each tray gently guides your smile into place without brackets or wires, giving you freedom to eat, brush, and speak comfortably throughout treatment.</p>\n        <p>Compared with metal braces, Invisalign offers several advantages:</p>\n        <ul><li>Nearly invisible: the smooth plastic blends with your teeth, so most people never notice you are in treatment.</li><li>No food restrictions: remove the trays to enjoy popcorn, crisp apples, or chewy favorites without worrying about breaking hardware.</li><li>Easy hygiene: brush and floss as usual—no weaving around brackets or struggling with special tools.</li><li>Fewer appointments: you swap trays at home and visit us every few months for quick check-ins and refinements.</li></ul>\n        <p>Invisalign works for a wide range of cases, from minor crowding to more complex bite issues. As a top-tier provider, we use digital scans to plan every movement and show you a virtual preview of your future smile before treatment begins.</p>\n        <p>Curious whether Invisalign is right for you? Schedule a consultation. We will map out your goals, share timelines and costs, and explain how clear aligners can fit seamlessly into your life.</p>\n        <p>For patients with overcrowded, crooked, or misaligned teeth, a straight, radiant smile instills confidence. But the traditional solution—metal and wire braces—can be uncomfortable, unsightly, and inconvenient.</p>\n        <p>For years, the possibility of traditional wire braces was a cause of unbelievable anxiety in teenagers, who didn’t want to feel uncomfortable or awkward. Even worse, many adults whose misaligned teeth needed to be fixed denied themselves the dental care they deserved because wire braces felt socially unacceptable. What upwardly-mobile professional wants to have metal braces? It may not seem fair, but most adults would rather put off necessary teeth alignment because of the uncertainty and stress caused by traditional metal and wire braces.</p>\n        <p>However, one name became a gamechanger for those who wanted an option over traditional braces: Invisalign . Over the past 20 years, Invisalign has emerged as the world leader in clear aligner technology. Invisalign’s research gives more predictable results with greater control. No other aligner solution can match the efficiency or effectiveness of Invisalign.The unique, custom-made clear aligners allow you to keep smiling straight through your treatment. No food restrictions. No social awkwardness. No hindrances to your career.</p>\n        <p>Both Invisalign and traditional braces are designed to enhance your smile and straighten your teeth. But there are many differences between the two, and Invisalign provides a variety of benefits metal and wire braces cannot.</p>\n        <h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil of Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n        <p>is often asked about the differences between Invisalign versus braces. As one of the leading providers of Invisalign in the country, he’s uniquely qualified to explain the distinctions between the two options. If you’re considering Invisalign, here are a few issues to consider when making your choice.</p>\n        <h2>What Is Invisalign?</h2>\n        <p>It’s hard to judge the differences of Invisalign versus braces until you know why Invisalign is so revolutionary. The Invisalign process begins by having your teeth digitally mapped by our advanced iTero scanner . In minutes, we can show you the predictive outcome of your Invisalign treatment. Yes, that’s right . . . on your first visit to Exquisite Dentistry, you’ll have an opportunity to see how your teeth will look after Invisalign.</p>\n        <p>Dr. Aguil will take these precise scans of your teeth and create clear plastic aligners to place on your upper and lower teeth. These trays will gently begin to shift your teeth in the right direction. Over time, you’ll receive new trays that will further guide your teeth until they’ve reached their proper placement. The process is simple, painless, and extremely effective.</p>\n        <h2>Restore Your Smile’s Brilliance</h2>\n        <p>With your smile the best it’s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY (323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n        <h2>Comparing Invisalign Versus Traditional Braces</h2>\n        <p>How does Invisalign stack up with old-school metal and wire braces? Consider these five different ways that the battle of Invisalign versus braces isn’t even close.</p>\n        <h3>1. Superior Design</h3>\n        <p>When fitted with traditional braces, you’ll have metal brackets glued to your teeth. Your dentist or orthodontist will then tie those brackets together using metal wires and small rubber bands. Brackets are often customizable—so you can try to match your enamel color or choose a bright color to purposely make them stand out when you smile.</p>\n        <p>Invisalign is ideal for patients who want their treatment to be more discreet. As the name suggests, Invisalign is difficult to see. The transparent plastic aligners blend so well with your teeth, most people won’t even know you’re wearing them!</p>\n        <h3>2. No Food Restrictions</h3>\n        <p>With traditional braces, there’s a whole grocery list of items you can’t eat . . . usually for at least two years. That means no gum, no sticky candy, and no popcorn (just to name a few). Eating one of these foods accidentally can cause one of your brackets or wires to pop loose, causing you to make an unplanned trip to the dentist.</p>\n        <p>Unlike traditional braces, you can remove Invisalign trays before eating. This helps you avoid the mess of food getting stuck between brackets and wires—and enables you to enjoy whichever foods you want! In the comparison of Invisalign versus braces, that’s another point for Invisalign.</p>\n        <h3>3. Fast Results</h3>\n        <p>With Invisalign, maintenance is extremely simple. You can clean the clear aligners by brushing and rinsing them in lukewarm water or by using anInvisalign Aligner Cleaning System. You’ll have your trays cleaned daily in minutes.</p>\n        <p>Braces require more meticulous brushing and care. However, if you brush too vigorously while wearing braces, you can damage the wires or brackets, so caution is necessary. This delicate balance makes your daily oral care routine much more complicated with braces versus using Invisalign.</p>\n        <h3>4. Confidence</h3>\n        <p>When compared versus braces, Invisalign’s clear aligners are comfortable and convenient. You can put your brilliant smile on display at work, at school, or while out on the town without any of the awkwardness that comes from traditional braces. Simply put, with Invisalign, life will continue on as normal. The only difference? Each day your smile will become even more dazzling!</p>\n        <p>.</p>\n        <p>At Exquisite Dentistry, we prioritize your oral health—providing advanced teeth straightening solutions such as Invisalign. But we can also offer other cosmetic and restorative dental services , like laser teeth whitening and dental bridges .</p>\n        <p>Best of all, when you visit Dr. Aguil and the team in West Hollywood, you’ll be comforted by the relaxing dental spa environment. You’ll love the essential oils diffusing in the lobby, the warm blanket you receive before your treatment begins, and the noise-canceling headphones that allow you to watch your favorite Netflix show on our televisions. Not only will you be receiving the best treatment, but you’ll be in the most relaxing environment you can imagine for dental work.</p>\n        <p>Want noticeable results without clunky, noticeable braces?</p>\n        <p>Reach out today to schedule an appointment. The difference between Invisalign versus braces is clear!</p>\n      </div>",
