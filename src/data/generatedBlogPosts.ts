  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>You\u2019re wanting to flash that beautiful Hollywood smile, but you\u2019ve got one problem: Your teeth. Perhaps they\u2019re discolored, misshapen, or don\u2019t align quite the way you want them to. Not only can discolored teeth cause social embarrassment and awkwardness, but they can also hold you back from career opportunities. Maybe you\u2019ve tried everything \u2014 special whitening toothpastes, bleach trays, and visits to the dentist. Yet, nothing seems to help. Is there any hope for a situation like yours? Absolutely! Dr. Alexie Aguil of Exquisite Dental, Los Angeles\u2019 leading dental spa, has treated hundreds of patients in this exact circumstance. His recommendation for you may be porcelain veneers for your teeth. Why Dental Veneers? When teeth are discolored, most patients try at-home remedies like bleaching kits and whitening toothpastes. The problem with these treatments is that they only lighten teeth a shade or two\u2026if at all. The effects are also only temporary, meaning that you\u2019ll be locked into an endless cycle of \u201cwhitening\u201d your teeth. Over time, this type of treatment can end up making your teeth extremely sensitive, which only compounds your problems. Veneers for teeth are the better way to take care of a smile that\u2019s not all it could be. That\u2019s because veneers can help in several different situations, including: Teeth that have been extensively discolored. This can happen from an excess of fluoride, tobacco use, or long-term use of certain prescription medications. Teeth with small cracks or chips, when a dental crown is not necessary. Teeth with worn enamel. Teeth that have small spaces in between them. Veneers for teeth are more than simply a whitening treatment. They\u2019re a simple and effective way to restore the natural beauty of smiles. What Are Dental Veneers? A dental veneer is a layer of porcelain that sits over the top of the teeth. This thin shell \u201cre-skins\u201d the teeth and makes them look as good as new. The porcelain coating will hide any imperfections in the teeth, like chips, and discoloration. Although other dentists may offer veneers for teeth made from other materials, porcelain veneers are superior for their long-term durability and resistance to staining. Don\u2019t settle for anything less!</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. What\u2019s The Process To Get Dental Veneers? Custom porcelain veneers for teeth requires a three-step process that will be spread out over three unique visits. Your initial visit: At this appointment, Dr. Aguil will do an oral exam to ensure that veneers are the right treatment option for you. After answering any questions you have, he\u2019ll take digital scans of your teeth advanced technology. You\u2019ll even be able to see a model of what your teeth will look like after treatment is complete! Your second visit: You\u2019ll receive gentle sedation to help make you comfortable. Then, a small portion of your teeth will be buffed off. Temporary veneers will be created and applied to your teeth so that we can get the fit just right. We\u2019ll send the exact specs to a lab so that the porcelain veneers can be created. Your final visit: Dr. Aguil will take the finished veneers for your teeth and gently put them in place. Once you\u2019ve seen that the fit and coloring are perfect, the porcelain veneers will be permanently bonded to your teeth. How Effective Are Veneers For Teeth? As soon as you\u2019re done with your third and final visit, you\u2019ll see a noticeable and dramatic difference in your smile. The effect will be absolutely stunning Caring for Your Veneers Your tooth brushing routine will not need to change once you get your veneers. Continue to brush twice a day for two minutes a turn. Also, make sure you floss once a day as well. You may find that your teeth become slightly more sensitive to hot and cold liquids, but this sensitivity should fade over time. Until then, consider using a toothpaste especially crafted for sensitive teeth. Your veneers will last a long time, but may need to be replaced anywhere from 5 to 15 years after the procedure.</p>\n<h3>Although your</h3>\n<p>porcelain veneers are created specifically to resist staining, they aren\u2019t impervious to stains. Avoiding tobacco products, coffee, and red wine will extend the time your veneers stay in perfect condition. If you were taking medication that stained your teeth before you got your veneers, talk to your physician about the possibility of switching medications The Best Place For Veneers: Exquisite Dentistry If you live in the greater Los Angeles area, you won\u2019t want to leave your veneers for teeth to just any dentist.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Much of the time, treatment with dental veneers is seen as a cosmetic procedure that insurance companies do not cover. At Exquisite Dentistry in West Los Angeles, Dr. Aguil has worked to not only create an amazing, spa-like environment for his patients \u2013 but he has also learned how to work within the rules of dental insurance to help his patients pay for the costs of enhancing your smile.</p>\n<h2>Insurance Companies Accepted by Exquisite Dentistry:</h2>\n<h3>Aetna</h3>\n<h3>Delta</h3>\n<h3>Cigna</h3>\n<h3>Guardian</h3>\n<h3>Anthem Blue Cross</h3>\n<h3>Blue Shield</h3>\n<h3>Principal</h3>\n<h3>Humana</h3>\n<h3>Melife</h3>\n<h3>United Health Care</h3>\n<h2>How to Make the Most of Your Insurance</h2>\n<p>While dental veneers aren\u2019t covered by insurance, the medical procedure of having crowns (sometimes called a \u201ccap\u201d) fitted and attached to teeth that in need of reconstruction is normally covered up to a certain point. With this flexibility in mind, Dr. Aguil finds ways for patients to have crowns installed as part of the overall plan for fixing their smile, giving them a little financial relief in the process. However, it needs to be pointed out that most insurance companies only typically cover 50% of the most basic crowns and have a cap around $2000 per year that can be spent on the procedure \u2013 and any upgrades or costs over that cap (as well as the cost for things like the wax used for forming the impression that is necessary to create the crown) will have to be paid for by the patient. These costs all tend to add up, and at an estimated cost of $1800-to-$2500 per porcelain veneer, the final bill is likely going to be pretty significant. Additionally, Dr. Aguil will not do veneers for a patient getting less than 6 veneers fitted and attached, and he typically prefers to work with 10 or more veneers when helping fix a patient\u2019s smile.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. Why Quality Veneers are Important Other dental offices may offer veneers lower cost, but those locations are likely able to charge less because they are going to fit patients with veneers (and crowns) made with inferior materials and crafted by companies with lower quality standards. In these situations, it\u2019s very likely that the veneers that these patients receive are going to break or fail, causing additional dental bills down the line.</p>\n<h2>Start with your First Appointment</h2>\n<p>Start a discussion about veneers with the understanding that the procedure is viewed as an elective, cosmetic choice and not be too shocked when you are told that you will not have your veneers covered by insurance.</p>\n<h2>Call Exquisite Dentistry at</h2>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 to schedule your appointment.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Do teeth naturally heal over time? The thought of someone\u2019s teeth regenerating sounds like science fiction to most. But it\u2019s not as far-fetched as you may think. Dentistry is evolving. According to a recent study from the journal Scientific Reports, researchers may be able to stimulate stem cells in your teeth to naturally repair defects\u2014including cavities, cracks, chips, and more. Though no clinical studies have been conducted on people as of yet, experts are hopeful that these findings will dramatically impact the future of dental care. When a tooth suffers damage, it loses something called dentin\u2014the hard, bony tissue underneath the enamel that forms the bulk of the tooth. Each tooth\u2019s stem cells produce new dentin, in an attempt to repair the damage. However, this innate repair mechanism has its limits and can only manufacture small amounts of tissue while combating a cavity, injury, or infection. This is why, under normal circumstances, teeth cannot heal themselves. In today\u2019s world, that\u2019s where dentists like Dr. Alexie Aguil work to restore damaged teeth to tip-top shape to prevent further damage and infection\u2014and reinvigorate your smile. But researchers believe this new method of stimulating tooth stem cells will \u201cgreatly enhance\u201d the natural repair of teeth when supported by Tideglusib, a drug commonly used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. So far, tests on mice have produced successful results. After drilling holes into subjects\u2019 molars, scientists stimulated the teeth\u2019s stem cells with a group of molecules found in Tideglusib. Within six weeks, the mice regenerated much the dentin lost in their teeth. The ultimate goal, according to researcher Paul Sharpe, is to stimulate stem cells enough to \u201cregenerate a whole tooth.\u201d If possible, stem cell treatments could eventually replace traditional cosmetic procedures.</p>\n<h2>Embracing Your Natural Beauty</h2>\n<p>Some researchers believe today\u2019s restoration methods do not preserve the natural look of your teeth. At Exquisite Dentistry, we use the highest quality technology and materials to give you the most brilliant, natural-looking smile possible. So, if you resort to closed-mouth smiles to hide a chipped or cracked tooth, you don\u2019t need to wait for a miraculous natural solution. In our comfortable, relaxing dental spa environment, Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team at Exquisite Dentistry will reinvigorate your teeth\u2019s health, beauty, and function\u2014designing the smile you\u2019ve always wanted. Are you still hesitant to have dental work done to stress and anxiety? We understand! That\u2019s why we offer pain-free sedation dentistry for patients feel they will benefit from it. Someday, researchers may perfect a method to enhance the natural repair of teeth. But in the meantime, we welcome all friendly faces to Exquisite Dentistry\u2014so you can become a happier, healthier, more confident you. Do teeth heal themselves over time? Not yet! That\u2019s why your best option for a healthy smile is to contact Exquisite Dentistry today to schedule your consultation.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>If you have dentophobia, or suffer from a fear of going to the dentist, you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s estimated that as many as one in five people avoid going to the dentist unless they require major dental work or something that is bad enough to require immediate attention. Unfortunately, seeing a dentist as little as once every few years or more can affect more than your oral health. Infections such as gum disease, which may present with few or no symptoms, can lead to serious health issues like heart disease and stroke. So what is a dentophobe to do? To begin with, find a dentist that not only understands your fear but caters to it. This may require a bit of research. While you may come across practices near you that advertise that they\u2019re \u201cgood with cowards,\u201d check their website and call the office before making an appointment. Do they offer sedation options for regular cleanings and fillings or only for bigger procedures? At Exquisite Dentistry, we specialize in making every patient feel comfortable, regardless of how minor of a procedure they require. We listen to your specific needs rather than following a one-size-fits-all standard of care. It\u2019s the pain that you\u2019re afraid of, right? It\u2019s a natural human response to avoid anything that might cause discomfort. Particularly if you\u2019ve been through pain from dental extractions in the past, it\u2019s understandable that you don\u2019t want to go through that again. The good news is, you don\u2019t have to. Pain free dentistry is absolutely possible with the right team of experts. Whether you have a toothache or it\u2019s simply past time to visit the dentist, the compassionate team at Exquisite Dentistry has all the tools to ensure that you have a good experience. We have perfected techniques like walking you through all the steps ahead of time and administering anesthesia in a new, painless manner that are designed to put even the most fearful patients at ease.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Adults have 32 teeth, but all it takes is one misshapen, damaged, or discolored tooth for a person to lose confidence in their smile. Dental veneers are a common way to improve the shape of teeth, fix chips or cracks, and give teeth a radiant natural color. If there\u2019s only one tooth troubling you, then you can have a single tooth veneer. Cosmetic dentists generally reserve treatment with a single veneer to repair damage. For a cosmetic dental treatment, the recommended number is 8-12 veneers per arch. Treating at least 16 teeth helps to match the color tone and shape of every tooth in your smile. It also helps ensure that your bite alignment is the best it can be for comfortable chewing.</p>\n<h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n<p>has been helping his patients for years by providing the highest-quality, best-fitting dental veneers. In three simple visits, you\u2019ll have a well-crafted veneer on one tooth that will last for many years to come. Why Choose a single tooth Veneer? Dental veneers are proven to be a fantastic way to improve a tooth, both structurally and cosmetically. Although veneers are often applied to all 32 teeth in certain cases, it\u2019s possible to simply have a veneer on one tooth. There are several reasons to get a single veneer. You\u2019ve cracked or chipped your tooth. For the sake of your oral health, you\u2019ll want to repair broken teeth immediately, as fissures in a tooth can cause infection and worsen over time. Your tooth has become discolored and doesn\u2019t match the shade of your other teeth. This can happen from prior dental work, injury, or other damage to the tooth. You currently have veneers, and one has broken long before its time. What\u2019s the Process of Receiving a Veneer for Just One Tooth? Having a tooth veneer placed on one tooth may sound like a complicated process, but it\u2019s fairly simple. From start to finish, your tooth will be transformed in three visits.</p>\n<h2>Initial Visit and Consultation:</h2>\n<p>During this first visit, Dr. Aguil will check your problematic tooth, as well as your overall oral health. Then, you\u2019ll get a 360-degree image of your mouth. Because Exquisite Dentistry uses the most advanced technology, you\u2019re ensured that your veneer will fit beautifully. Your Second visit: While your porcelain veneer is being created by the leading dental laboratory on the West Coast, Dr. Aguil will place a temporary veneer in its place. This short-term veneer for one tooth allows you to get a better sense of how the final veneer will feel, and it also allows you to offer feedback before the final veneer is put in place.</p>\n<h3>Your Final Visit:</h3>\n<p>Here is where the completed veneer will be placed over your tooth. After checking the fit and color to make sure everything is as it should be, the veneer will be permanently placed on your tooth.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. Who Would You Choose for a Veneer for Just One Tooth? It\u2019s unfortunate, but you can spot a cheap veneer from a mile away. They often have a fake, plastic look that appears completely unnatural. By replacing your chipped or stained tooth with a sub-par single-tooth veneer, you\u2019ll simply be trading one problem for another. Veneers can be a wonderful solution for enhancing your smile, but you must be extremely careful of where you get your veneers from. You\u2019ll want a dentist who is an experienced professional. Your dentist needs to have the dedication, education, experience, and materials necessary for such an important task. Dr. Aguil and the team at Exquisite Dentistry have been transforming smiles in the West Hollywood and greater Los Angeles area for years. Because he uses only the most advanced equipment and the highest grade materials, you can be sure that you\u2019ll receive a natural-looking veneer that will be among the best anywhere. No shortcuts \u2014you deserve the best! Why You Might Want More than a Veneer for One Tooth Dr. Aguil recommends a set of veneers for at least 8 teeth per arch to provide you the best results possible. While less expensive, a veneer for a single tooth may not match perfectly with the rest of your smile. This is the case both for both the color and shape. Getting comprehensive treatment with 16 or more dental veneers gives you the chance for a brilliantly white smile, and teeth with just the right spacing. You\u2019ll also have a chance to optimize your bite for proper alignment which provides for better oral health.</p>\n<h2>Choose Exquisite Dentistry for Your Veneers</h2>\n<p>When you choose Exquisite Dentistry, you\u2019ll also enjoy our unique dental spa environment. Does the thought of a traditional dentist make you nervous? Have you put off your dental work because you don\u2019t want to have to deal with the bright light, loud sounds, and the harsh drilling? If so, you\u2019ll especially appreciate the dental spa treatment you\u2019ll get at Exquisite Dentistry. As soon as you enter the lobby, you\u2019ll notice the difference. Whether it\u2019s the soft lighting, the scent of essential oils diffusing in the air, or the warm welcome you\u2019ll receive from our compassionate staff, you\u2019ll immediately feel at ease. When it\u2019s time for your appointment, you\u2019ll settle into a large, comfortable chair with a warm blanket. Watch your favorite Netflix show while you wear Bose noise-canceling headphones if you\u2019d like. Whether you\u2019re looking for a veneer for one tooth or an entire set, you can expect a truly exquisite experience. Contact us today online or call (323) 272-2388, and we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions or set up your consultation for your veneer.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>The Art of Perfecting Smiles: Veneers for Your Four Front Teeth</h2>\n<p>When it comes to achieving the smile of your dreams, cosmetic dentistry offers transformative solutions. Among these, porcelain veneers are a powerful treatment for achieving radiant, perfectly shaped teeth. Whether you\u2019re aiming for a dazzling Hollywood smile or seeking to restore damaged teeth, veneers for your front teeth can be the key to unlocking newfound confidence and beauty. You might also be wondering about veneers for your four front teeth. While often used to address damage, these targeted veneers can also serve various cosmetic purposes, from repairing minor imperfections to enhancing your smile\u2019s overall symmetry and alignment. When consulting your dentist about this procedure, several crucial factors must be considered.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Dental Veneers</h3>\n<p>When you first talk to your dentist about veneers, they can help you decide on the details you need, including how many teeth should be treated. For cosmetic enhancement, it\u2019s recommended to apply veneers to the front eight teeth on both the top and bottom rows, totaling 16 teeth\u2014it\u2019s a comprehensive approach that ensures a thoroughly bright and beautiful smile. Dental veneers are thin strips of material bonded to the front of teeth to improve their shape and appearance. At Exquisite Dentistry, our porcelain veneers are crafted from top-quality materials and closely resemble the natural look of teeth.</p>\n<h3>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h3>\n<p>has extensive experience in both traditional and cosmetic dentistry. Renowned for his expertise in smile enhancement, he has earned a stellar reputation through years of specialized practice in procedures ranging from veneers and Invisalign clear aligners to root canals and laser teeth whitening.</p>\n<h2>When to Get Veneers for The Four Front Teeth</h2>\n<p>While extending veneer application to all prominently visible teeth is recommended for a seamless aesthetic, your cosmetic dentist might suggest concentrating solely on the front four teeth for particular reasons. This focused strategy can effectively address minor chips, cracks, or gaps between teeth and enhance bite alignment. However, applying only four veneers to cut costs is not advisable. Your smile deserves the best; compromising quality can detract from its overall appearance and longevity. For those in the Los Angeles area, Dr. Alexie Aguil can guide you in determining the optimal number and placement of veneers for your individual needs.</p>\n<h3>Comprehensive Veneer Treatment</h3>\n<p>Dr. Aguil suggests treating 8 to 12 teeth per arch for a harmonious smile design. This approach accounts for factors such as overall bite alignment and tooth color consistency, ensuring a natural-looking result. If you look for a less expensive option to treat fewer teeth or use lower-quality veneers, you may have more issues that can be costly to address later on. Lower-quality veneers may not give you the long-term result you were expecting. Investing in high-quality porcelain veneers for most of your smile helps prevent future issues and additional expenses associated with inferior materials.</p>\n<h2>Premium Service for Exceptional Results</h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking to get an entire set of veneers for your four front teeth, our team at Exquisite Dentistry is here to guide you through the process and offer the highest-quality care and results.

Porcelain veneers are also a standout solution for teeth whitening, often used to address a range of dental concerns like chipped, crooked, or misaligned teeth. Veneers and teeth whitening go together like the stars and the moon, offering a shining combination for achieving a brighter, more radiant smile that lasts. Since veneers are custom-designed to fit over the front surface of your teeth, they effectively conceal your teeth discoloration rather than removing stains like traditional whitening treatments. If you\u2019re looking for a long-lasting solution to teeth whitening, veneers are a great choice.</p>\n<h2>Veneers for Teeth Whitening at Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>At Exquisite Dentistry, we see how a beautiful smile transforms lives every day. Crafted from the highest-quality porcelain, artfully shaped, and applied with utmost precision, Exquisite Dentistry makes veneers that are natural-looking and stunning. Closely collaborating with one of the finest dental laboratories in the United States, award-winning cosmetic dentist Dr. Aguil works to ensure that your veneers fit your smile perfectly, and match the shape and alignment of your natural teeth. A member of the prestigious Kois Institute, Dr. Aguil brings decades of experience to customizing veneers. He leverages state-of-the-art technology and techniques to provide patients with the highest standards of care and artistry.</p>\n<h2>Choosing Veneers for a Full and Brilliant Smile</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever tried whitening strips, pens, or in-office whitening treatments, you know that the results don\u2019t last forever\u2014and often don\u2019t deliver the desired whiteness. Unlike temporary whitening treatments that require frequent touch-ups, porcelain veneers are a more permanent solution to teeth whitening. For some people, even repeated whitening treatments don\u2019t achieve the white and bright color they yearn for\u2014either because their natural pigmentation has a gray or yellow cast or because of persistent damage due to medicines, vitamin deficiency, or aging. Dr. Aguil will guide you in choosing the ideal color for your smile based on your natural coloring and goals\u2014one that is white and natural-looking rather than overpowering and artificial. Everyone has seen photos of people with glaringly white teeth that scream, \u201cThese aren\u2019t real.\u201d At Exquisite Dentistry, we consider the whole of you and our decades of experience to inform you of what will look best and most beautiful for you. In addition to improving the color of your teeth, porcelain veneers can also address other cosmetic concerns like uneven spacing, minor misalignment, or worn enamel, providing a comprehensive solution for enhancing your smile. What\u2019s more, porcelain veneers are easy to care for. To keep your veneers looking their whitest, simply maintain good oral hygiene habits, including regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups.</p>\n<h2>Consult with Dr. Aguil About Your Porcelain Veneers</h2>\n<p>Ready to discover a long-lasting solution to a whiter, more radiant smile with veneers?

  "excerpt": "Dental Veneers vs.  Bonding: What\u2019s Right for You?",
  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Dental Veneers vs. Bonding: What\u2019s Right for You? While cleaning and cavity protection are important, dentists can do much more to dazzle your smile. Cosmetic dentists specialize in treatments that help straighten, fill gaps, whiten, repair damage, and completely transform your smile. Among those options, dental veneers and bonding stand out as popular choices for enhancing the appearance of your teeth and brightening smiles.\u00a0When it comes to dental veneers vs. bonding, there are a few key differentiators to consider before deciding which treatment is best for you: Dental veneers can correct and enhance the color, shape, and overall appearance of your teeth, creating a flawless smile. Crafted from durable, high-quality porcelain, veneers are thin shells placed over your teeth to permanently fill gaps, correct crooked teeth, and whiten your smile. In the hands of a highly skilled cosmetic dentist like Dr. Aguil, porcelain veneers offer a natural-looking and long-lasting solution for correcting dental imperfections and achieving your ultimate smile. Dental veneers are best for:</p>\n<h2>Comparison Points</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Permanent smile enhancement</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Major imperfections</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Severe discoloration</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Significant damage</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Misalignment</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dental bonding is primarily used to repair damaged teeth and can be a more natural-looking alternative to metal fillings. Dental bonding involves the application of a tooth-colored resin, akin to the material used for filling cavities, which adheres to teeth and hardens under a specialized curing light. Bonding can effectively address certain minor dental imperfections, such as small chips or gaps. Dental bonding is best for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cavities</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Minor imperfections</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Small fixes or adjustments</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Filling in gaps</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When evaluating dental veneers vs. bonding, at Exquisite Dentistry, Dr. Aguil first assesses your case and goals and discusses the distinction between using veneers and bonding to enhance or restore your smile. Once you agree on the best approach, Dr. Aguil will craft a highly personalized cosmetic dental treatment plan. What\u2019s The Difference: Dental Veneers vs. Bonding?</p>\n<h2>Dental Veneers</h2>\n<p>Veneers come in all ranges of quality. At Exquisite Dentistry, our veneers are made of the highest-quality porcelain that are thin yet durable. The veneers are applied to teeth using a strong bonding material after your natural teeth are trimmed down to accommodate them. Once secure, veneers instantly remedy cracks, stains, or gaps while also aligning teeth into an ideal position. However, with more challenging cases, the process can be done in as few as three to four visits. It may take a couple more to ensure the optimum fit, shape, and color. The advantage of veneers is that you can refine them until you achieve the perfect result for your smile. Once you\u2019re done, you have a beautiful smile that will last for years and years with proper care and regular visits to the dentist for oral hygiene check-ups and exams.</p>\n<h3>Dental Bonding</h3>\n<p>Bonding begins with the application of a flexible dental resin onto the teeth. Once in place, the resin is hardened with a special light that binds it to the tooth. While bonding offers several benefits, such as cavity filling, reshaping teeth, or closing gaps, it\u2019s worth noting that the hardened resin isn\u2019t as durable as the porcelain used in veneers and that the bonding material doesn\u2019t lend itself as well to fine micro-adjustments in shape and color.</p>\n<h2>The Limitations of Bonding</h2>\n<p>While bonding is versatile and reliable, it only offers some of the capabilities of veneers. The dental resin used in bonding is not as strong or durable as porcelain, making it prone to chipping, and its porous nature makes it susceptible to stains and fading. Therefore, bonding is primarily recommended for filling cavities and making minor adjustments to teeth.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Veneers</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the customizable nature of veneers, patients can enjoy a tailored solution that precisely matches the color, shape, and size of their natural teeth, resulting in a beautiful and seamless enhancement of their smile. Veneers offer a long-lasting and durable option for improving the appearance of teeth, providing not only aesthetic benefits but also functional advantages for years to come. While veneers provide a long-lasting solution for achieving a radiant smile, maintaining good oral habits remains crucial. It\u2019s essential to be mindful of dietary choices, to use a mouthguard at night and during sports activities for added protection, and to adhere to a consistent regimen of brushing and flossing daily. These practices help preserve the integrity of your veneers and contribute to overall oral health and longevity.</p>\n<h2>Exquisite Dentistry: Expert Porcelain Veneers in LA</h2>\n<p>For personalized guidance on whether dental veneers or bonding is the right treatment for you, talk to an experienced and trusted cosmetic dentist.

Cosmetic dentists specialize in treatments that help whiten teeth, repair damaged teeth, and even design the new smile you always wanted.

In the hands of highly-skilled doctors, like Dr. Aguil, porcelain veneers are exceptionally long-lasting and natural-looking.</p>\n<h3>Dental Bonding</h3>\n<p>is a similar treatment to the one used by dentists to fill cavities. It\u2019s typically used to repair damaged teeth, and a more natural-looking alternative to metal fillings. The procedure uses a tooth-colored resin that hardens and bonds to teeth when exposed to a special curing light. While bonding can be used to achieve some of the same effects, veneers are recommended for the best results. Your dentist may use either or both as part of your cosmetic dental treatment.

What\u2019s the Difference: Veneers vs Bonding?</p>\n<h3>Dental Veneers</h3>\n<p>Veneers are thin-yet-durable pieces of porcelain material that are fitted to teeth using a strong bonding material. Your current teeth will be shaped to provide the most natural shape and position for the new veneers. Once applied, the veneers can improve the color of the teeth, as well as removing cracks, stains or gaps while aligning teeth into a more ideal position. The process generally takes about three visits to your dentist. Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have a beautiful smile that will last for many years with proper care and regular visits to the dentist for hygiene check-ups and exams.</p>\n<h3>Dental Bonding</h3>\n<p>Bonding starts with a malleable dental resin applied to the teeth. The process does not generally require any enamel to be removed. Once in place, the resin is hardened with a special light that binds it to the tooth. Bonding has a lot of potential benefits to help fill cavities, change the shape of teeth, or fill in gaps, but the hardened resin material is not as durable as the porcelain used in veneers. An expert cosmetic dentist will be able to show you the difference in using veneers vs. bonding for enhancing or restoring your smile.</p>\n<h2>Bonding Isn\u2019t for Everything</h2>\n<p>As versatile and reliable as bonding is, it can\u2019t quite do everything veneers are used for. The dental resin is not as strong or durable as porcelain veneers\u2014making it more susceptible to chipping. The resin material is also more porous than porcelain\u2014making it more susceptible to stains and fading. For this reason, bonding is best used to fill dental cavities and to make small fixes or adjustments in teeth. Whether it\u2019s dental veneers or bonding, a cosmetic dentist like Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry will select the best methods available to help you achieve your dream smile.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Veneers</h2>\n<p>High-quality porcelain veneers used at Exquisite Dentistry are a long-lasting solution for improving your smile and addressing minor alignment issues. Porcelain veneers created by Dr. Aguil are among the best custom-made veneers available in Los Angeles, California. The expert care involved in a custom veneer treatment will help you achieve an ideal smile that will be more natural-looking and longer-lasting. It\u2019s still best to be vigilant about what you eat, wear a mouthguard at night, but especially while playing sports, and be sure to brush and floss daily to maintain your veneers. You\u2019ll be rewarded with beautiful results lasting many years.

  "excerpt": "For effective treatment to restore the shape and color of your teeth, you have a choice in the form of dental veneers or crowns.  Both options provide relief in the way of creating a bright, healthy smile \u2013 but each goes about solving our dental problems in\u2026",
  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>For effective treatment to restore the shape and color of your teeth, you have a choice in the form of dental veneers or crowns. Both options provide relief in the way of creating a bright, healthy smile \u2013 but each goes about solving our dental problems in very different ways.</p>\n<h2>Veneers \u2013 Improving on a Good Foundation</h2>\n<p>Good for addressing minor damage, discoloration, or even addressing small adjustments to a person\u2019s teeth for a natural bite alignment, veneers are a popular cosmetic treatment. At Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles, we offer porcelain dental veneers that can be sized and bonded in as few as three visits. Porcelain is a tough material that is naturally resistant to stains (although you must continue to brush and floss and go in for dental cleanings). Porcelain veneers are hand-crafted and sculpted to fit on top and around the biting edge of your teeth, filling in small chips or fixing any oddly-shaped teeth with a bright, clean shell on the top of your existing teeth.</p>\n<h2>Crowns \u2013 Fixing the Bigger Issues</h2>\n<p>For those of us who have larger issues that require restorative dental work, Exquisite Dentistry offers restorative services like bridges, implants, and crowns. Dental crowns are used when the tooth or teeth need a much bolder solution than a simple covering like a veneer can solve. Sometimes called \u201ccaps,\u201d a crown covers up to the entire surface area of the tooth, effectively replacing the entire exterior of the tooth to protect the core and nerve canal. Like veneers, the crowns used at Exquisite Dentistry are created with porcelain due to its durability, transparency, and natural ability to fight off stains. The process for sculpting a porcelain crown is a longer process, as the tooth (or teeth) in question have to have impressions done (to create the porcelain caps) and those sent out for the construction of the crown. The process for creating a crown usually takes approximately two weeks. Meanwhile, the teeth that will receive your new crown will be prepped \u2013 meaning the outer surface of the tooth is shaved down to the correct level for the crown to fit on top. While you are waiting for your porcelain crown to be sculpted and sent back to you, Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team will fit you with a temporary crown to protect your prepped tooth or teeth. When the crown is ready to be permanently placed on the prepped tooth, another visit to Exquisite Dentistry will have it bonded and you will be ready to start enjoying your new smile.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>Choosing Your Best Option</h2>\n<p>Scheduling an appointment with Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry is the first step towards determining which option is best for you. A key factor in deciding crowns or veneers will depend on the work you want to be done and the level of damage to the teeth you want to get worked on. If the teeth have only minor chips, damages, or discoloration, then it\u2019s likely that a porcelain veneer will be the choice that Dr. Aguil suggests for you. Alternatively, if the teeth you want to correct are seriously damaged, it\u2019s likely that a porcelain crown will be the recommendation. Crowns are designed to be a much more substantial solution and intended to be used when no other restorative option can handle the level of repair that needs to be done. Both processes will require multiple visits to the dentist office, but after discussing your options and the steps necessary to achieve your desired smile, the time and visits will pay off with that gorgeous smile that you\u2019ve always wanted.</p>\n<h2>The Cost of Veneers vs Crowns</h2>\n<p>Comparing the financial side of getting veneers or crowns is not an apples-to-apples decision. Veneers are usually the cheaper option \u2013 but that\u2019s because they are considered a strictly cosmetic option and don\u2019t require the same levels of prep or porcelain material. On the flip side, porcelain crowns are viewed as a reconstructive solution to a medical problem and can even be covered by insurance companies. Veneers are often used for improving smiles through small adjustments to issues like gaps in your teeth or possibly correctly a slightly out of alignment bite. Because they\u2019re often seen as an elective cosmetic treatment, most insurance companies will not cover them. When you are looking to having a better smile and a healthier mouth, making a choice based on the cost is not the correct path. Meeting with Dr. Aguil and discussing what you want to accomplish and then going through an appointment where he does a thorough assessment will be the best way to come up with a plan for fixing or reconstructing your desired smile. This may mean a combination of veneers and crowns instead of one of the other, or it could even mean a process involving cleanings, Invisalign treatment (to move your teeth into the desired places), and then finally having your crowns or veneers professionally attached to your teeth.</p>\n<h2>Find Treatment for Veneers and Crowns at Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles will help you set the best plan for achieving the bright, eye-catching smile that you\u2019ve always deserved. Dr. Aguil\u2019s office offers general dentistry as well as cosmetic dentistry that is considered among the best in Los Angeles. Appointments at Exquisite Dentistry are nothing like the cold, sterile trips you remember growing up \u2013 but instead will remind you of being in a spa-like environment where comfy chairs, complimentary music and movies, and warm blankets are just a few of the customer service perks that Dr. Aguil\u2019s team have helped pioneer.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>You can feel a searing pain in your mouth that radiates into your jawbone. It may even seem to shoot down from your mouth all the way to your toes, causing you pain that can range from irritating to severe. The aching pain feels almost constant, and you\u2019re having difficulty getting anything accomplished because of the throbbing. Sound familiar? If this is how you feel, you\u2019re exhibiting some of the classic symptoms of a cracked tooth. Although you may feel like you can put off a cracked tooth repair, you\u2019ll be doing yourself a great disservice by waiting to have it looked at.</p>\n<h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n<p>of Exquisite Dentistry has seen hundreds of cases just like yours, and he understands the urgency of having your cracked tooth repaired quickly. To help make you aware of the severity of your condition, consider this helpful information as you ponder the next steps you\u2019ll need to take.</p>\n<h2>Causes of a Cracked Tooth</h2>\n<p>Even though the enamel that composes your teeth is the hardest substance of the body, that doesn\u2019t mean that your teeth are indestructible. There are several potential ways for a tooth to crack. A cracked tooth can be the result of general wear and tear on your teeth as you age or if you grind or clench your teeth. A blow to the mouth or other accidents to the facial area can also cause cracked teeth. Chewing on hard foods like nuts, hard candy, or even ice can crack a tooth. Believe it or not, you can even crack a tooth by exposing it to extremes in temperature such as eating hot food and following it with a glass of ice cold water.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of a Cracked Tooth</h2>\n<p>So, how can you tell if you have a cracked tooth? There are some common cracked tooth symptoms that can help the dentist determine whether or not that is your problem. These symptoms can include pain when chewing, increased sensitivity to hot or cold, a feeling of roughness or sharp area on your tooth, and constant or intermittent pain. However, don\u2019t let the absence of these symptoms convince you that you don\u2019t need cracked tooth repair. There are some instances where you may experience no pain at all, yet still be suffering from a crack in your tooth. If you\u2019re in doubt, stop by our office and receive a professional examination. It\u2019s not worth taking a risk!</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>Risks of Leaving a Cracked Tooth Untreated</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important to see a dentist as soon as possible in order to prevent any further damage to your tooth, pulp, and nerves. An untreated cracked tooth could lead to further damage to the tooth pulp, which contains nerves and blood vessels. When tooth pulp is exposed, you run a high risk of infection. Although the risk of infection may not seem to be a big issue, if your pulp and gums become infected, it can open up a host of other unpleasant health issues. Beyond this, if the crack extends into the root, you may need to have a root canal or even an extraction. All of these more unpleasant options are normally avoidable if the cracked tooth is repaired in a timely manner.</p>\n<h2>Potential Cracked Tooth Repair Solutions</h2>\n<p>What if you suspect that you\u2019ve cracked a tooth? If you\u2019re experiencing any of the symptoms of a cracked tooth, you\u2019ll need to schedule an appointment for a visit to the dentist so that he or she can determine the exact nature of the problem and provide the best treatment options. It\u2019s important to do this as quickly as possible. As far as the type of cracked tooth repair that will be utilized in your unique case, Dr. Aguil tells his patients that the type of fracture and its severity determines the form of treatment he utilizes. MInor cracks rarely need treatment, but more serious issues such as a fractured cusp, vertical crack, or split tooth may require dental crowns, root canals, or endodontic surgery. If the crack has progressed too far, it\u2019s possible you may need to have a extraction. However, Dr. Aguil can replace the extracted tooth with a dental implant or customized dental bridge which will provide you with a very natural looking result.</p>\n<h2>Cracked Tooth Repair From Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>At Exquisite Dentistry, we provide general dentistry services as well as root canal procedures, dental crowns, and implants to patients in Los Angeles.

Dental veneers are an excellent option for those looking to enhance their smile and correct dental issues. These thin, meticulously crafted porcelain shells fit over your natural teeth to conceal imperfections and discoloration. In just a few visits to your dentist, teeth that were once chipped, misshapen, or stained are transformed. But you might be wondering, do you need surgery for dental veneers? The answer is no. The process of applying veneers does not involve surgery and is much simpler than you might imagine. Keep in mind, that doesn\u2019t mean surgery is never used. In some cases, surgery may be needed to achieve optimal results. Exquisite Dentistry offers some of the finest veneer treatments for those living in the Los Angeles area. Led by Dr. Alexie Aguil, Exquisite Dentistry has been helping patients achieve the smile of their dreams with veneers for over two decades.</p>\n<h2>The Porcelain Veneer Process</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re concerned about surgery for porcelain veneers, there\u2019s no need to worry because there\u2019s no cutting or incisions. In fact, the veneer process may be quite painless. Let\u2019s go over the steps it takes to achieve a brilliant smile with veneers at our cosmetic dental practice in West Hollywood: Initial consultation Before discussing treatment options, Dr. Aguil recommends a teeth cleaning and exam to determine if porcelain veneers are the right option for you. Next, using cutting-edge equipment, Dr. Aguil takes a 3D image of your bite. These images guide the creation of your veneers for a tailored fit that matches your unique dental structure. You\u2019ll discuss your needs and preferences with Dr. Aguil during the consultation. Together, you\u2019ll specify your veneers\u2019 desired shape and color, ensuring that the final result aligns with your expectations and complements your facial features.</p>\n<h3>Temporary Restorations</h3>\n<p>After your first visit, Dr. Aguil sends the digital impressions of your teeth to a top dental laboratory for fabrication. Before your final veneers are ready, Dr. Aguil applies temporary restorations. These short-term veneers will show you how your permanent veneers will look and feel. You\u2019ll try them out for a few weeks to ensure you like your veneers\u2019 look, shape, and feel before permanent application. Should fine-tuning be necessary, Dr. Aguil will work with the lab to adjust and refine your permanent veneers to meet your preferences and ensure optimal comfort. While surgery remains unnecessary for veneers, it\u2019s important to note that Dr. Aguil will expertly shape your teeth for application to accommodate a precise fit.</p>\n<h3>Permanent Application</h3>\n<p>Once your permanent veneers are delivered from the lab, Dr. Aguil permanently bonds them to your teeth. The veneer application process is quick and gentle. Before you know it, you\u2019re on your way out of the office with a brand-new smile and a newfound confidence.</p>\n<h2>Porcelain Veneers at Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>Although veneers aren\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for every situation, they\u2019re a wonderful choice for those looking to make cosmetic changes to their smile\u2014and, as we\u2019ve said, no surgery is needed for them.

For women, a brilliant smile is important not only because it showcases your beauty. Smiles also help tell the world that you\u2019re happy, healthy, and confident. However, a hidden risk to your health may be more common than we thought. A new study reports that \u201cwhile oral cancer is common in both men and women, statistics show that there is an increased rate of women at risk for getting the disease from ages 55 to</p>\n<h2>Key Points</h2>\n<ol start=\"62\">\n<li><strong>\u201d Equipped with the knowledge of the risks to female smokers, the most important steps you can take are to learn the facts and how to protect yourself.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Oral Cancer Screenings and Preventative Care</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious culprit: tobacco. According to a 10-year study conducted in Ireland, Irish women \u201chad more cases of oral cancer because of tobacco smoking.\u201d You\u2019ve heard it before, but unfortunately, the facts haven\u2019t changed. The unsettling truth is that female smokers are at risk for oral cancer at higher numbers. While difficult to eliminate, taking steps toward quitting the habit can be the first line of defense in protecting your oral and overall wellness.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. Oral cancer can manifest in a number of ways. While it usually takes place in the throat, cheeks, gums, and lips, tumors can also invade the floor of the mouth, buccal mucosa, and mucosal surface of the lip. These nasty biters have also been found in the retromolar triangle, hard palate, alveolus, and anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This information may be overwhelming, so it\u2019s important to talk to your dentist about getting a screening for oral cancer.</p>\n<h2>Signals to Other Important Areas of Your Health</h2>\n<p>In addition to keeping your smile radiant, your oral health can be an important indicator of other areas that may be impacted.</p>\n<h2>Studies from the CDC</h2>\n<p>have shown a strong association between oral cancer and the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), which can be sexually transmitted. Again, the risks are even greater for female smokers. Viruses and fungi that heavy smokers contract from tobacco are often identified as triggers of oral cancer. Areas of the mouth associated with HPV are directly linked to the development of the disease. This doesn\u2019t mean that you should abstain from living and enjoying your life. However, for a long healthy life, make lifestyle choices based on habits that keep your body strong, fit, and disease-free.</p>\n<h2>Early Detection Makes for a Great Start</h2>\n<p>To quote philosopher Sir Francis Bacon, \u201cKnowledge is power.\u201d Nothing puts you at the wheel quite like learning the facts. Early detection not only gives you the opportunity to know your status early-on, but it also enables you to seek treatment before the issue worsens. Empower yourself with the tools of how to prevent oral cancer from spreading, learn the recommended methods of tobacco reduction, get referrals for HPV screenings, and identify\u2014with the help of your dentist\u2014other risks of oral cancer to help you maintain a healthy and beautiful smile. If you feel you are at risk for oral cancer, it\u2019s time to get proactive about your health. Contact us today for your annual cancer screening consultation.</p>\n      </div>",

Googling the long list of doctors on Yelp doesn\u2019t help, because it tells you nothing about their chairside manner, philosophy on patient care, and expertise. The path to finding a good dentist in your area begins with paying attention to word of mouth and written reviews. Whether you\u2019re in need of a general cleaning or more major dental work like a root canal, who better to recommend a dentist than someone who\u2019s recently spent time in their exam room? Once you\u2019ve picked a doctor, it\u2019s a good idea to make a list of questions and schedule a time to sit down with him or her to discuss them. Most of us experience at least mild anxiety regarding visiting the dentist, and meeting the doctor ahead of time in relaxed atmosphere can help ease this fear. Making the search easier If you have dental insurance, another one of the best ways to find a dentist in your area is with a list of qualifying doctors from your plan. Like Yelp, this still isn\u2019t going to give you a detailed review of the dentist\u2019s practice, but it helps narrow down the list of candidates. When reading reviews and asking around for referrals, make sure to ask about the office team. Each time you visit the office, you\u2019ll be interacting not just with the doctor but with the folks at the front desk, the hygienist and the person in charge of billing. A happy, relaxed and friendly team tells you a lot about the dentist. The atmosphere in any office starts from the top.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.

We\u2019ve worked hard to create an office that our patients love, and we\u2019re happy to share with you what makes a high-end dental office so unique.</p>\n<h2>High-End Dental Offices Have the Best Technology</h2>\n<p>If you need some help developing a smile you can be proud of, you\u2019ll want to consider cosmetic dentistry. In the past, this meant that you\u2019d have to put up with a mouth full of metal for two years. However, high-end dentistry offers newer, more effective solutions. Today\u2019s cosmetic dentistry offers many innovative ways to improve your teeth\u2019s appearance, from laser teeth-whitening to veneers. At Exquisite Dentistry, we have the latest in laser teeth whitening technology. Our Zoom! Advanced teeth whitening system can provide you teeth that are eight shades whiter in about an hour. No bleach. No messy trays. No need for multiple visits to the dentist. We also utilize cutting-edge technology such as the 3D Orthophos SL Cone Beam, which assists in high-quality dental implants, and the VELscope Vx, which catches oral cancer at its very earliest stages. You\u2019ll especially love our iTero Scanner, which can show you the final results of your intended treatment in just minutes.</p>\n<h2>High-End Dental Offices Have the Best Atmosphere</h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve all experienced the traditional dentist office. The lobby filled with year-old magazines you have no interest in reading. The bright lights shined in your eyes while you\u2019re tipped back in a hard, vinyl-covered chair. The loud buzzing of dental equipment. It seems like the entire experience seems to be designed to make you uneasy from the moment your walk through the front door. Instead, wouldn\u2019t it be better to visit a dentist office where you can actually relax? Imagine an environment that was created to ease the frayed nerves of dental patients. It would be the kind of place that more resembled a spa than a dentist\u2019s office. The lighting would be soft, the d\u00e9cor would be tasteful, and the air would smell of peaceful essential oils. You\u2019d sit in a comfortable chair with a warm blanket. Instead of listening to the sound of a drill, you could listen to your favorite music with noise cancelling headphones. If only you could find such a place! The good news is that such a place already exists: Exquisite Dentistry. Our dental spa atmosphere will surprise you. But, once you experience our unique, relaxing office once, you\u2019ll never want to go back to a traditional dentist\u2019s office again!</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>High-End Dental Offices Have the Best Team</h2>\n<p>Of course, all of these wonderful tools and amenities are of little value if the office\u2019s dentists and team are not caring and compassionate. You need to have a dentist who will carefully listen to your concerns and will help you feel confident that your needs are being put first.</p>\n<h3>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h3>\n<p>and his team at his team have been providing high-end dentistry to their patients since 2006. At the time, Dr. Aguil recognized the glaring problem in dentistry: the lack of high-end dental offices that can provide a next-level experience. He set about fixing this issue when he opened his office. He put his years of experience in patient care into creating a holistic practice that treats the entire person. Your comfort is his main concern. Dr. Aguil was a pioneer in the area of dental spas, and his office remains a leader in this type of care.</p>\n<h2>Your High-End Dental Office Is Close By</h2>\n<p>We all know that taking care of oral health is critical to overall health, but many of us avoid the dentist because of a negative past experience. Unfortunately, keeping away from the dentist may not seem like a problem in the short-term, but over time your issues will compound. If you\u2019re needing to find a dentist, a simple Google search will turn up a list of doctors near your location. Finding a dentist is easy. Finding a dentist you can trust, that\u2019s not so simple! How do you sort through all of the reviews?

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>A glass of wine with a good meal or an ice-cold beer while you\u2019re watching the game\u2014for some people, these are some of life\u2019s simplest pleasures. Unfortunately, the effect alcohol has on your dental health is not as pleasant. If you drink in moderation, you might not worry much about what those Friday night cocktails or weekend suds are doing to your mouth. Understanding how alcohol affects your teeth is the best way to enjoy the occasional drink\u2014without sacrificing your smile.</p>\n<h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil at</h2>\n<h3>Exquisite Dentistry</h3>\n<p>, Los Angeles\u2019 premiere dental spa, recently gave this advice for those who drink alcohol.</p>\n<h3>Dry vs. Sweet</h3>\n<p>The high-sugar content in some alcoholic drinks can lead to tooth decay and cavities so that extra vodka and cranberry could be doing more damage than you think. Mixers are often to blame\u2014those dire warnings your dentist makes about sugary sodas and fruit juices still apply when they\u2019re mixed with spirits! Where possible, opt for a sugar-free option like soda water with some fresh mint\u2014just as satisfying, without the toothache. When it comes to wine, there\u2019s a general rule that\u2019s easy to remember\u2014the sweeter the flavor, the more sugar it likely has. Dry wines often have less residual sugar from the fermentation process while maintaining a rich, fruity flavor.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h3>Enamel Staining</h3>\n<p>The occasional drink doesn\u2019t have to cost you your pearly smile\u2014but it will if you don\u2019t take care of your teeth. Red wine contains dark pigments called chromogens that can cause dullness and long-term discoloration. Dark beer and dark soda mixers are also culprits: the acid in the drinks softens the enamel on your teeth, increasing the risk of staining. Drinking through a straw is a good way to minimize teeth staining, though not always practical. If you must sip, rinse your mouth with water between drinks to minimize your enamel\u2019s exposure to the offending liquid\u2014it\u2019ll also help to reduce your hangover the following day by keeping you hydrated! Using a whitening toothpaste before going to bed will also help combat the alcohol\u2019s staining effects.</p>\n<h3>Other Risk Factors</h3>\n<p>Another good reason to drink water alongside alcohol is to prevent dehydration. You\u2019ll find your saliva flow decreases after a few alcoholic drinks, meaning your mouth can\u2019t naturally wash away bacteria sticking to your teeth. Chewing sugar-free gum is another option to get the saliva flowing again, and helps keep your breath fresh even after a few beers. Speaking of beer, if you drink it regularly, consider switching to a low-carb brand. The lower acidity and higher water content make it better for your teeth, and your waistline\u2014that\u2019s one way to avoid a beer belly. Finally, if you habitually crunch the ice in your drink, your dentist implores you to stop. Chewing ice can chip and crack your teeth, not to mention worsening your sensitivity and wearing down your enamel. It\u2019s best to leave the ice in the glass. Following these simple tips will help keep alcohol from affecting your teeth, but don\u2019t forget to keep up with your regular dental appointments to spot any issues early. If you are a moderate to heavy drinker, you should also consider undergoing an oral cancer screening due to the direct link between alcohol and dental health. Contact us today for more information, as well as for an in-office consultation.</p>\n      </div>",

That\u2019s what porcelain veneers can do for you. Hollywood-style veneers can correct discolored or misshapen teeth to totally transform your smile. What are Hollywood Porcelain Veneers? Veneers are a super-thin layer of porcelain that are gently bonded to the front of your teeth. They can be applied in as few as three dentist visits. When you work with a world-class cosmetic dentist like Exquisite Dentistry, you can expect to come away with a completely natural-looking smile. To consult with a leading cosmetic dentist in West Hollywood, give us a call at (323) 272-2388 or Contact us online for a consultation.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. Who Are Hollywood Veneers For? If you\u2019re thinking the best veneers in Hollywood are for patients with stained, discolored teeth, you\u2019re absolutely correct. But there are several other excellent reasons to choose porcelain veneers: Your enamel is thin. In cases like this, you may be experiencing sensitivities to hot and cold. Your teeth may even look translucent. In these cases, a veneer will act as a protective shield to your teeth. Your teeth are chipped or cracked. Dental crowns are often used in situations where teeth are severely cracked, but occasionally that solution is not the best choice. For less extensive damage, dental veneers may be the perfect option. They\u2019ll smooth out the surface of the tooth and make it look as good as new. Your teeth have gaps between them. In certain cases, using veneers to fill the gaps between teeth is a quicker and easier choice that undergoing orthodontic work. Where Do I Get Hollywood Veneers? The best place to get your Hollywood-style veneers is\u2026 Hollywood! Work with Dr. Alexie Aguil of Exquisite Dentistry expert care in a truly relaxing and comfortable environment. The offices of Exquisite Dentistry were the inspiration for the modern Dental Spa. From the moment you walk in the door, you\u2019ll be greeted warmly by the personable team. The soothing sights and smells will put you at ease. When you\u2019re invited into one of our comfortable chairs, you\u2019ll be treated to a warm blanket and your choice of music or Netflix through noise-canceling headphones.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Proper oral care is more than just supporting a stunning smile. Your teeth can indicate a variety of health concerns that most don\u2019t even think about. Did you know that neglecting your teeth and gums poses a risk to your oral and overall health? This can potentially cause issues or increase your risk for conditions that you might expect to be unrelated.</p>\n<h2>Health Issues Caused or Exacerbated by Poor Oral Health</h2>\n<p>Heart attack Stroke Osteoporosis Rheumatoid Arthritis Pneumonia Spread of Infection When problems arise, scheduling an appointment with a renovative dentist such as Dr. Alexie Aguil in West Hollywood can help you get to the root of the problem. Dr. Aguil and his team at Exquisite Dentistry will work out what the next steps are in your treatment plan and put you on the right track to achieve oral wellness.</p>\n<h2>Healthy Teeth, Better Bones</h2>\n<p>Many of us dread going to the dentist and put off our appointments until tooth decay has already set in. Would you do the same when it comes to visiting your cardiologist for acute chest pain? The answer is most likely \u201cno\u201d. Unfortunately, oral health isn\u2019t always a priority when it should be. People suffer through sensitive, cracked teeth every day without realizing a beautiful smile isn\u2019t all that\u2019s at stake. Teeth with damage or decay are at risk of infection or inflammation, which can affect your jaw and compromise the bone. Osteoporosis is a real threat for patients with weakened bone structures caused by oral health problems. Cracked, injured teeth don\u2019t repair themselves over time, meaning it\u2019s up to you to take the initiative and seek treatment. Good oral and overall health are two forms of preventative care that can also give you beautiful teeth. Knowing your mouth like you know your body and learning how to take care of it is important for maintaining a fulfilling lifestyle and feeling good about it.</p>\n<h2>Problems in Your Mouth, Problems Overall</h2>\n<p>Most of us tend to take the words \u201cheart condition\u201d or \u201clung disease\u201d more seriously than \u201cperiodontal disease,\u201d despite strong evidence that oral health and heart health are interlinked. We take daily measures to prevent heart and lung disease from impacting our quality of life. Why shouldn\u2019t we do the same for our oral health? Our mouths are entry points for the different types of infection and bacteria we encounter every day. Oral health problems can be quick to develop in the teeth and gums where proper care and protection hasn\u2019t been provided. From there, inflammation and bacteria can travel to other parts of the body and turn into a life-threatening problem affecting your oral and overall health. When bacteria from infected teeth or gums enters the bloodstream, the results can be devastating. Poor oral health can cause heart attacks and stroke due to bacterial collecting in the arteries. If bacteria are in the lungs, it can turn into pneumonia. Oral health problems can also help diagnose other unknown issues affecting the rest of the body. Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS can develop sores in their mouths as a side effect of immunodeficiency. Blood diseases and diabetes also impact your teeth and gums by weakening your body\u2019s ability to fight infection, therefore increasing your risk of periodontal disease.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>A Healthy Diet Affects Oral and Overall Health</h2>\n<p>Healthy eating and drinking also play a role in preventative care when it comes to problems with oral health. Due to the sugar content in most alcoholic beverages, patients who consume alcohol in moderation are less likely to develop periodontal diseases, stained teeth, or blood sugar disorders. Avoiding overindulgence with junk food is good for your teeth and your waistline.</p>\n<h2>Minding Your Oral Health</h2>\n<p>Preventative care and early treatments for oral and overall health problems are far better than waiting and addressing the problem when it might be too late.</p>\n<h3>Knowing</h3>\n<p>the signs for early oral cancer are important, but consulting professionals and having regular oral cancer screenings can help spot what our eyes cannot. If you\u2019re a smoker, quitting is another healthy habit to pick up. Female smokers are at a greater risk of developing oral cancer, which can go on to spread and affect their overall health. But it isn\u2019t just tobacco smokers in danger: people who use marijuana are also more likely to develop severe oral health problems as well. When you brush and floss properly, you\u2019re removing food particles and bacteria that could otherwise build into plaque or tartar. Brushing twice a day for two minutes each can greatly reduce your chances of developing oral health problems. Getting an electric toothbrush and finding time to floss are two easy things you can add to your routine. Check out these 5 tips for improving oral care, even on a workday. Even with daily care, schedule regular teeth cleanings. Consistent visits with dental professionals who can recognize early signs of oral health problems are the most efficient way to stay on top of your overall health. Healthy is Beautiful With so much depending on your mouth, you need to find a world-class dentist to help maintain your healthy lifestyle. For patients looking for a dental experience that feels less like a doctor\u2019s appointment and more like a spa treatment in Los Angeles, see Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team at Exquisite Dentistry.

Whether you pick up a box of themed candy, or choose a sampler with dozens of assorted chocolates, February 14th has always been a day where it just feels right to sweeten things up. Chocolate is one of the more popular choices, and is considered to be a powerful aphrodisiac\u2014but it\u2019s also packed with sugar, and we don\u2019t have to tell you it\u2019s not tooth-friendly. But hey, it\u2019s your day with your sweetheart, so we say indulge and enjoy! Ok, dental health doesn\u2019t sound sexy, but maybe that kiss will be. That\u2019s why we are dedicated to helping you keep yours as healthy it can be. Here\u2019s a few healthy Valentine\u2019s Day ideas from Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry.</p>\n<h2>Cooking Together</h2>\n<p>Making a meal with someone special is a fun way to spend your Valentine\u2019s Day. This also gives you the opportunity to incorporate healthy ingredients\u2014so you can focus on foods that taste great and doesn\u2019t hurt your teeth. Recipes that contain lots of vegetables, cheeses, meats, and crunchy fruits are best for keeping teeth clean and strong. For example, green leafy veggies such as kale and spinach are full of calcium and phosphorus\u2014two minerals that are essential in strengthening tooth enamel. Cheese also contains calcium, and was reported by the American Academy of General Dentistry to raise pH levels in the mouth, which lowers your risk of tooth decay. Fruits contain sugar, but the effects are diluted by the high water content that helps fight bacteria. The greatest benefit from fruits such as apples and pears comes their fiber, which can also give your teeth a good scrubbing before and after a meal. So, if spending the day together in the kitchen sounds good, find a tasty recipe and get cooking!</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h3>After Dinner</h3>\n<p>Maybe cooking isn\u2019t your thing, or you\u2019re looking for a healthy Valentine\u2019s Day idea that\u2019s more tangible. Or perhaps you want a way to freshen up after a fancy, romantic dinner. There are dozens of dental products that you can give your partner on Valentine\u2019s Day to maintain and improve dental health\u2014and overall wellness.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Essential Dental Care Tips for the Perfect Wedding Smile: Before, During, and After</h2>\n<p>A wedding is one of the most memorable days in a person\u2019s life. With all eyes on the bride and groom, it\u2019s essential to ensure that your smile is as perfect as your outfit. A radiant smile boosts your confidence and enhances those precious photographs you\u2019ll cherish forever. In this blog, we will provide essential dental care tips before, during, and after the big day to help you maintain that perfect wedding smile.</p>\n<h2>Pre-Wedding Dental Care Planning</h2>\n<h3>Start Early</h3>\n<p>Begin your dental care routine months before your wedding day. This gives you ample time to address any issues, from teeth whitening to more extensive dental work. Consult your dentist at least six months before the wedding to discuss your goals and create a personalized plan.</p>\n<h3>Regular Dental Check-Ups</h3>\n<p>Ensure you schedule regular dental check-ups. Professional cleanings can remove stubborn plaque and tartar, ensuring your teeth and gums are healthy. Your dentist can also identify and address any potential issues before they become significant problems.</p>\n<h3>Consider Invisalign</h3>\n<p>Invisalign treatment is the perfect choice for those looking to discreetly straighten their teeth before their wedding day. Invisalign aligners are virtually invisible, making them ideal for brides and grooms who want to enhance their smiles without the noticeable look of traditional braces. With regular use and periodic adjustments, you\u2019ll achieve a confident and stunning smile just in time for your special day.</p>\n<h3>Teeth Whitening Options</h3>\n<p>Consider professional teeth whitening treatments to achieve a dazzling smile, and make sure to consult your dentist to choose the best method for your teeth. Remember to avoid staining foods and beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine leading up to your wedding.</p>\n<h2>Daily Dental Care Routine</h2>\n<p>Maintaining teeth health is crucial for overall well-being, and keeping up with daily duties can play a significant role in this. Keep a strict brushing and flossing routine; brush your teeth at least twice a day using fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush, and floss daily to remove food particles and plaque between your teeth and gums. Additionally, you can also incorporate an antibacterial mouthwash into your daily routine to help eliminate bacteria, freshen your breath, and promote overall oral health.</p>\n<h2>On the Wedding Day</h2>\n<h3>Morning Dental Routine</h3>\n<p>Start your wedding day with a thorough dental routine.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re smile isn\u2019t everything you want it to be, you may feel like you have to settle for less than the best. Fortunately, this simply isn\u2019t the case. Today, there are several different remedies to help correct crooked, misplaced teeth. Consistently, there\u2019s one option that brings the best results and makes patients more satisfied than any other:</p>\n<h2>Invisalign</h2>\n<p>. What Is Invisalign? Invisalign is the premier option for those looking to straighten their teeth without the intrusion of traditional metal braces. Millions of people have used Invisalign since their introduction in 1999, and they have been a truly transformational product in the world of orthodontics. Instead of using metal wires and brackets, Invisalign works completely differently. When you choose Invisalign, your orthodontist will create a mold of your mouth and take several scans of your teeth and their positioning. These will be used to fashion the Invisalign trays out of a durable high-tech plastic, which will gently begin to move your teeth into their desired position. Several sets of trays will be fashioned to continue to adjust the position of the teeth until they are in their optimal position. Why Choose Invisalign? There\u2019s several smart reasons for choosing Invisalign. Some choose their devices for their convenience. Having the ability to take the trays in and out of your mouth means that you\u2019re in control of the process, which is impossible with traditional braces. Also, old-fashioned metal braces require a following a long list of eating restrictions. No popcorn. No soda. No chewing gum. The list feels endless and can be quite restrictive. Of course, the cosmetic value of Invisalign can\u2019t be understated. Where traditional braces will fill your mouth with metal, the Invisalign trays are transparent and almost unnoticeable. Imagine the confidence boost you\u2019ll receive from straightening your teeth with this advanced system! Is Invisalign Painful? Invisalign is a far less intrusive way to straighten your teeth than traditional braces, but many patients still ask the question\u2014does Invisalign hurt? This is a fair question. Although everyone wants to have a smile they can be proud of, you don\u2019t want to be in pain the entire time you\u2019re mouth is undergoing its transformation. Any time you\u2019re having a procedure that involves moving teeth, there is going to be some discomfort involved. However, pain from Invisalign is generally considered to be much less than the pain caused by traditional braces. Most patients report that, while Invisalign does hurt for a few days after getting a new set of trays, the soreness is quite manageable\u2014and significantly less than with traditional braces. While Invisalign is less painful than traditional metal braces, we recommend you make an appointment with the dentist to discuss your concerns. At Exquisite Dentistry, one of the best dentists for Invisalign Braces in Southern California, we will work with you to make sure you\u2019re completely comfortable with your treatment plan. We will be more than happy to help you answer the question, \u201cDoes Invisalign hurt?\u201d Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h3>Invisalign Provides Options</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts about the Invisalign process is how versatile it is, especially compared to metal braces. Because Invisalign trays are removable, if your Invisalign tray does hurt your teeth or gums, you can easily take them out to give your mouth some relief. Try doing that with metal braces! Consider this scenario to understand the benefits of Invisalign. You have an important meeting at work, and you\u2019ll be making the key presentation. However, the day before, you had an orthodontist appointment. If you have traditional braces, you likely woke up in pain with little hope of relief. All you can do is take a pain reliever and hope you feel better. However, if you have Invisalign, you likely have little to no discomfort whatsoever. If for some reason, Invisalign does cause your teeth to hurt, all you have to do is take it out. Simple! Invisalign works with your busy life. One of the other benefits of Invisalign is that your dentist can work at whatever pace is comfortable for you. Invisalign\u2019s system is easily customizable, allowing you to take things at a pace that is the most comfortable for you.</p>\n<h2>Taking It One Tooth at a Time</h2>\n<p>The slight hurt that does come from Invisalign aligners can be alleviated by focusing only on one part of your smile at a time rather than your entire mouth. Even if you do that, you\u2019ll be surprised at the fast results you get. Nowadays, it can seem that everyone is going around with a nice, straight set of pearly whites. With Invisalign, you too can be flashing your confident smile in no time. Do you want a better idea of what your smile will look like? Check out our Smile Gallery to see just a small sampling of our success stories. Of course, once you begin to consider Invisalign, you need to make sure you can get it from a dentist you can trust. That\u2019s why residents in the greater Los Angeles area trust Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team at Exquisite Dentistry. Our office has the most advanced technology to ensure that you have the best possible outcome each visit. Also, you\u2019ll immediately fall in love with our office, which many of our patients say resembles a day spa more than a dentist\u2019s office. We work extremely hard to make sure that the atmosphere you\u2019re surrounded with when you walk through the door is one of peace and relaxation. Now that we\u2019ve shown you that Invisalign doesn\u2019t hurt like traditional braces, it\u2019s time to get your own Invisalign clear aligners.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Advanced Cosmetic Dentist for Adults in Los Angeles: What to Expect</h2>\n<p>Nowadays, pediatric dentists are decked out with all sorts of amenities to make children feel comfortable and at ease during their dental visits. But have you ever wondered why the same level of care and comfort isn\u2019t readily available when it comes to visiting a cosmetic dentist for adults? What if you could enjoy your dental visit in a comfortable, stress-reducing environment? What if your dental appointment left you feeling the way you do after visiting a spa: calm, confident, and glowing? That\u2019s what we do at Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles. Step into our spa-like office designed with adult comfort in mind and experience a whole new level of dental care\u2014one that genuinely prioritizes relaxation and your overall well-being. Our unique approach considers every aspect of your dental experience, from making an appointment to treatment to checkout and follow-up.</p>\n<h2>Routine Dental Visits as Part of a Healthy Lifestyle</h2>\n<p>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle encompasses more than just diet and exercise. The condition of your mouth plays a significant role in your body\u2019s ability to function. Beyond the aesthetics of a bright smile, the health of your teeth and gums can have profound implications for your entire body.</p>\n<h3>Research</h3>\n<p>has shown that gum disease, caused by bacteria in the mouth, can contribute to the development of heart disease and increase the risk of stroke. As we become adults, the inflammation and infection associated with gum disease can also exacerbate existing heart conditions such as diabetes, HIV, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s. Just as you visit the doctor for an annual checkup, even while getting adequate exercise and eating a balanced diet, so too should you visit the dentist for regular cleanings, even with proper oral hygiene habits. Each time you eat, you introduce bacteria into your mouth, which leads to plaque buildup on teeth. If not properly removed, plaque can contribute to gum disease and tooth decay. While brushing and flossing are effective at removing plaque from the surfaces of the teeth and between them, they may not eliminate all plaque. Over time, this plaque hardens into tartar (or dental calculus), which cannot be removed by brushing and flossing alone. Professional dental tools, such as scalers and ultrasonic devices, are necessary to effectively remove tartar during a dental cleaning. That\u2019s why regular dental cleanings are crucial for maintaining oral health and preventing gum disease in adults. Furthermore, the alignment of your mouth also affects your overall health.</p>\n<h3>Studies</h3>\n<p>show that proper dental alignment can help prevent issues such as orofacial pain and temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ). Good alignment also promotes optimal oral hygiene by facilitating effective brushing and flossing and reducing the risk of plaque accumulation and gum disease. And don\u2019t forget the power of proper teeth alignment to enhance confidence in social interactions and overall self-esteem. For adults, treatments like porcelain veneers and Invisalign are great options to straighten teeth, correct your bite, and improve your oral health. In Los Angeles, Exquisite Dentistry makes it easy to see a cosmetic dentist for adults. Our practice is geared to the needs of those 16 years and up. Dr. Aguil and his team can help you avoid or remedy dental issues that could have a cascading impact on your overall physical and emotional well-being.</p>\n<h2>Expect More from Your Experience</h2>\n<h3>Dr. Aguil</h3>\n<p>pioneered the concept of the \u201cdental spa\u201d environment. He continues this dedicated approach today, providing a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere that complements world-class care. From the moment you step into Exquisite Dentistry\u2019s Los Angeles office, you\u2019ll feel the difference.

Here, a comfortable experience isn\u2019t just a luxury\u2014it\u2019s a key part of our exceptional care.</p>\n<h2>Feel Good, Look Great</h2>\n<p>As we mature, our teeth matter greatly to our appearance and health.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Teeth straightening is becoming one of the most popular and sought-after cosmetic dentistry treatments. Traditionally, getting braces has been thought of as a straightening treatment for tweens and teenagers, but more and more adults these days are interested in improving their smiles. Whether for cosmetic reasons, improved dental health, or a combination of both, having a straighter smile can not only improve your self-confidence but can also help to prevent or treat issues such as gum disease, TMJ, and tooth decay. The question then becomes how long does it take to fix crooked teeth in adults? Treatment with traditional metal braces can take up to two years. If you\u2019re looking for a quicker fix for that perfect selfie at an upcoming wedding or you\u2019re thinking about those graduation pictures at the end of your senior year, you\u2019ll want to consider some of the newer options for correcting crooked teeth. Clear aligners such as Invisalign are among the best ways of how to fix crooked teeth in adults. They can help move teeth quickly and are becoming one of the most popular options for straightening teeth. However, not everyone is a candidate for this type of orthodontia. Well\u2014How Crooked Are They? If you ask your dentist the question of how long it will take to straighten your teeth, he or she will tell you that it depends on the severity of the problems. In cases involving severely crooked teeth, large gaps, and alignment problems, the more traditional metal braces are most likely the best option. Additionally, if there are issues with your back teeth or if there is a need to rotate teeth or move them vertically, metal braces may also be the better choice for you. Invisalign is a great treatment option for adults wondering how to fix crooked teeth. Patients with more common issues such as overbites, underbites, crossbites, crowded or gapped teeth are the best candidates for Invisalign. The clear aligners are comfortable to wear, easy to use, and are very effective for straightening teeth and improving your smile without the pain and discomfort of traditional metal braces. How Long to Straighten Teeth? Faster Than You Think! If you\u2019re feeling that it\u2019s time to fix your crooked teeth and are wondering if Invisalign is the right treatment option for you, then it\u2019s time to talk to Dr. Alexie Aguil, Invisalign dentist at Exquisite Dentistry in West Hollywood. His mission is to create that perfect smile for you or to enhance the one that you already have. Invisalign is one of the best ways to give you the smile you\u2019ve been looking for. Using this new teeth straightening technology, we will fit you with a custom-made series of aligners, specifically designed to shift your teeth into more ideal positions. In the end, how long will it take to fix crooked teeth in adults? Although each case is unique, most patients need about 12 months to get the desired results from Invisalign. How does that compare with the length of time it takes to use traditional metal braces? Invisalign can usually straighten teeth in half the time as how long it takes to straighten teeth with metal braces.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h3>The Invisalign Difference</h3>\n<p>The difference between Invisalign and traditional braces is clear... no pun intended! Patients love the cosmetic benefits that Invisalign offers. Where traditional braces fill your mouth with metal brackets and wires, Invisalign trays are made of clear, hard plastic. Because they\u2019re transparent, they\u2019re almost invisible to the eye. Most people won\u2019t even know you\u2019re wearing them. Compare that to how adults fix crooked teeth with metal braces! Invisalign aligner trays are removable which makes for easier cleaning and overall maintenance. Because they can be taken in and out. They also allow you to eat whatever food you want. Of course, this is different from traditional metal braces, which are hard to brush and floss and have restrictions on what types of food you can eat. You won\u2019t be able to chew gum, eat popcorn, hard candy, or a host of other foods and drinks. This isn\u2019t the case with Invisalign, with which nothing is restricted. Most patients also report that they feel considerably less pain with Invisalign as well. Any time teeth shift in the mouth, there is a level of discomfort. However, Invisalign patients can expect to deal with much less gum irritation and tenderness that they would from wearing metal braces. For all these reasons, you can see how Invisalign is the superior way to fix crooked teeth in adults.</p>\n<h2>Invisalign From Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>For those who wonder how to fix crooked teeth in adults, you\u2019ll need to remember that the length of time for how long it will take to straighten your teeth will vary. The amount of time and amount of trays needed to correct your dental issues can only be decided after an initial consultation. That means you\u2019ll need a dentist who has the experience and know-how to give you the smile that you deserve. This is exactly why you should call Exquisite Dentistry. Our high-end dentist office is different from many other dentists that you\u2019ll find. We utilize the latest technology, like Invisalign, to make sure you have the best possible outcome every time you visit our office. We also have designed our practice to be more calming than a traditional dentist\u2019s office. When you step through the door, you\u2019ll immediately feel the difference. Our waiting room is designed to look, feel, and even smell more like a day spa than a dentist\u2019s office. When it\u2019s time to be seen by Dr. Aguil, you\u2019ll be seated in a comfortable chair and handed a warm blanket. While our expert team works their magic, you can watch your favorite TV show on Netflix using our noise cancelling headphones. It\u2019s a soothing experience that\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ll find almost anywhere else.</p>\n<h3>Call Exquisite Dentistry</h3>\n<p>How long will you wait to straighten your teeth?

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Actor Anthony Hopkins once ironically stated, \u201cGetting old ain\u2019t for the faint of heart.\u201d How true that is! But even if the rest of your body isn\u2019t as young as it used to be, your smile doesn\u2019t have to go with it. In fact, with diligent attention to oral care, mature adult teeth and gums can withstand the effects of aging. Of course, it\u2019s not just the cosmetic aspect of a beautiful smile that should concern you. Healthy teeth and gums are intrinsically linked to overall health, confidence, and the ability to enjoy a fulfilling lifestyle. Be true to your teeth and they won\u2019t be false to you!</p>\n<h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h2>\n<p>and his team at Exquisite Dentistry help patients of all ages achieve peak oral health. He\u2019s often asked by his patients for advice on how to keep excellent oral health as a senior. If you\u2019re trying to turn back the clock on your oral health, consider these tips as you strive for a healthier, brighter smile.</p>\n<h2>Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body and Mind</h2>\n<p>As a mature adult considering your oral health, you actually have to think beyond your teeth. The condition of your teeth and gums have a direct impact on the overall function of your body. Most older adults consider a visit to the dentist one of the least important health appointments on their calendar\u2014and the easiest to cancel. However, this is a short-term solution that can cause long term problems you\u2019ve likely never even considered. If you have to limit what you eat due to cracked teeth or diseased gums, it can affect your overall nutrition. The ability to chew determines what and how much you can eat. You want to avoid becoming the older adult who can no longer enjoy a meal because of the sheer effort it takes to chew foods you love\u2014a nice steak, a chewy bagel, or corn on the cob\u2014because the texture is too much of a battle. In addition, there\u2019s the discomfort and infection that comes with gum disease and cavities. We all remember the agonizing pain from a childhood toothache; it doesn\u2019t get any less painful as we age, and periodontal disease can be even worse. Of course, gum disease doesn\u2019t only affect your mouth. Far from it. Study upon study has proven gum infections are contributing factors to heart disease, stroke, diabetes\u2014and yes, even erectile dysfunction. Early research also indicates a connection between the bacterium from chronic gum disease and cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer\u2019s. Of course, surgeons understand the link between gum disease and overall health. This is why a trip to the dentist for an oral care exam is often required for mature adults before major surgery. Many surgeons will not perform a scheduled procedure until they receive a clean bill of health from the patient\u2019s dentist.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>How to Keep Excellent Oral Health for Seniors at Home</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest boosts to at-home oral wellness is ultrasonic toothbrushes. They can dramatically eliminate bacteria and food caught between teeth. Pair this with regular flossing\u2014ideally, once or twice daily\u2014and you\u2019ve made major inroads into limiting potential problems. Don\u2019t forget that the key to good brushing is following the 2\u00d72 principle; brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day for maximum results. Older adults often ask Dr. Aguil about teeth bleaching products. While most packages of teeth bleaching products feature young models, they can provide good oral care for mature adults as well. Whiter teeth can take years off how you look and be a big confidence booster. If you need a more intensive approach, in-office treatments are the way to go. Consider Exquisite Dentistry\u2019s Zoom Laser teeth whitening. We can help your teeth turn eight shades whiter in about an hour!</p>\n<h2>How to Keep Up Oral Health for Seniors at the Dentist</h2>\n<p>Dental care is a lifelong habit. Good oral care for mature adults includes regular teeth cleanings. Cleanings every three to six months are essential to prevent issues and to identify and treat problems. Like most everything else in life, early treatment is less invasive, time-consuming, and costly. No matter how well we brush and floss at home there are areas, especially below the gum line, where it takes a trained hygienist to reach. Without it, bacteria and infection can grow and compromise the supporting bone and also lead to foul breath. Sometimes, no matter how hard we try to take good care of our teeth, problems can arise. The idea is to minimize teeth replacement\u2014it\u2019s a lot better to have just one or two tooth implants versus a full set of dentures. Older patients should also regularly have a thorough oral cancer screening to check for any signs of cancer. Oral cancer can be extremely treatable if found early. Our VELscope Vx is an advanced oral-screening device that can catch oral cancer in its earliest stages.</p>\n<h2>Seniors Shouldn\u2019t Ignore Their Oral Health</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been putting off a visit to the dentist, stop by Exquisite Dentistry of West Hollywood.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, legalizing recreational marijuana use across the state. Although marijuana was available in retail stores in 2018, many cities and municipalities still have not created regulations for the sale of marijuana, while other locations outright banned their sale. This has created a hodgepodge of rules that hindered Californian\u2019s access to legal cannabis. However, if you think this slowed down Californian\u2019s appetite for pot, you\u2019d be mistaken. Despite the issues with supply, it\u2019s estimated that retailers in the state sold over 3 billion dollars worth of legal weed in 2018. This number is staggering and towers over the sales figures from other states where marijuana is legal. With easier access to the drug, Californians 21 and older must consider the effects of using cannabis\u2014including increased health risks, such as periodontal disease. According to a study featured in the Journal of Periodontology, people who use marijuana regularly \u201cdemonstrate increased indicators of mild, moderate, and severe gum disease.\u201d In short, smoking marijuana hinders oral health. What Is Gum Disease? Periodontal disease is characterized by infections around your teeth, including the gums, alveolar bone, and periodontal ligament. While gum disease can settle in without pain, you can identify it early if you notice inflammation in the gum line or other symptoms such as receding gums, persistent bad breath, trouble chewing, loose teeth, and sensitive teeth or gums. The most common known cause of gum disease is bacteria found the plaque that forms on your teeth. If plaque is not cleaned properly, it hardens into tartar\u2014which cannot be removed by brushing and flossing. By keeping up with your regularly scheduled dental cleanings, you can reduce your plaque buildup, and in turn, minimize your risk of developing periodontal complications.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. What\u2019s the Link Between Marijuana and Gum Disease? A common indicator of periodontal disease is the space between your teeth and their surrounding gum tissue. These \u201cpocket depths\u201d often tell dentists how likely patients are to develop periodontal disease. For example, healthy gum tissue fits closely around your teeth. The study mentioned above found that marijuana users tend to have larger \u201cpocket depths\u201d than non-users, leaving users more exposed to bacterial infection. Simply put, marijuana users are more vulnerable to gum disease. \u201cAt a time when the decriminalization of marijuana use is becoming more common in the U.S.,\u201d says Dr. Terrence J. Griffin, president of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP), \u201cusers should be made aware of the impact that any form of cannabis can have on the health of their gums.\u201d During your next check-up, be sure to notify your dentist of all risk factors, including regular marijuana use. Gum disease can be avoided! To learn more about how you can prevent periodontal disease, please reach out today to schedule an appointment!</p>\n      </div>",

But even if the rest of your body isn\u2019t as young as it used to be, your smile doesn\u2019t have to fade. In fact, oral wellness with age gets easier as mature adult teeth and gums can withstand the effects of aging. Of course, it\u2019s not just the cosmetic aspect of a beautiful smile that should concern you. Healthy teeth and gums are intrinsically linked to overall health, confidence, and the ability to enjoy a fulfilling lifestyle.</p>\n<h3>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h3>\n<p>and his team at Exquisite Dentistry help patients of all ages achieve peak oral health. His patients often ask him for advice on how to keep excellent oral health as a senior. If you\u2019re trying to turn back the clock on your oral health, consider these tips as you strive for a healthier, brighter smile.</p>\n<h2>Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body, and Mind</h2>\n<p>As you age, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader implications of oral health beyond just your teeth. Your dental well-being directly impacts your overall health and quality of life. Neglecting dental appointments can lead to long-term issues that affect your ability to enjoy a varied diet and maintain proper nutrition. Moreover, conditions like gum disease and cavities not only cause discomfort but also pose serious risks to systemic health, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and even cognitive decline. In addition, some discomforts and infections come with gum disease and cavities. We all remember the agonizing pain from a childhood toothache; it doesn\u2019t get any less painful as we age, and periodontal disease can be even worse. Of course, gum disease doesn\u2019t only affect your mouth. Many studies have proven gum infections are contributing factors to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Early research also indicates a connection between the bacterium from chronic gum disease and cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer\u2019s. Of course, surgeons understand the link between gum disease and overall health. This is why a trip to the dentist for an oral care exam is often required for mature adults before major surgery since many surgeons won\u2019t perform a scheduled procedure until they receive a clean bill of health from the patient\u2019s dentist.</p>\n<h2>How to Maintain Excellent Oral Health at Home</h2>\n<p>Investing in an ultrasonic toothbrush can significantly improve your at-home oral care routine by effectively removing bacteria and food particles. Combine this with regular flossing\u2014ideally done once or twice daily\u2014to further reduce the risk of dental problems. Remember to adhere to the 2\u00d72 principle: brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day for optimal results.</p>\n<h3>Routine Dental Visits</h3>\n<p>Dental care is a lifelong habit. Oral wellness with age includes practices like regular teeth cleanings every three to six months to prevent issues and identify and treat problems. Like everything else, early treatment is less invasive, time-consuming, and costly. An annual oral cancer screening is imperative to catching potential issues early on. Like your routine physical or mammogram, this simple screening can detect signs of oral cancer in its earliest stages, when treatment is most effective. Our VELscope Vx is an advanced oral screening device that can catch oral cancer in its earliest stages Regardless of how well we brush and floss at home, areas, especially below the gum line, take a trained hygienist to reach. These hard-to-reach spaces can harbor plaque and tartar buildup, which, if left untreated, can lead to gum disease and other oral health issues. Neglected areas can also contribute to foul breath, affecting oral health, overall confidence, and well-being. A skilled hygienist is vital in performing thorough cleanings, removing stubborn plaque and tartar, and ensuring that your teeth and gums are healthy and free from harmful bacteria. Proper daily dental hygiene and a dental visit every 4-6 months are essential for maintaining oral wellness. Sometimes, no matter how hard we try to take good care of our teeth, problems can arise. The idea is to minimize teeth replacement\u2014having just one or two tooth implants is much better than a full set of dentures.</p>\n<h3>Illuminate Your Smile</h3>\n<p>Teeth bleaching products can also benefit mature adults by enhancing the brightness of their smile and boosting confidence. Whether preparing for a special occasion or simply looking to rejuvenate your smile, teeth whitening options can be a game-changer. For a more intensive approach, consider our in-office Zoom Laser teeth whitening treatment. This cutting-edge procedure can be used to whiten teeth by up to eight shades in just one hour, offering unparalleled convenience and effectiveness.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>\u201cDo you floss?\u201d the dentist asks you as you settle into the chair for your appointment. You say yes. But the barely used box of floss that\u2019s been sitting in your medicine cabinet for a year has a different story to tell! Many of us are guilty of forgetting to floss. You have a bus to catch, or kids to take to school, or you just want to go to bed. We get it. But among the American Dental Association\u2019s oral care recommendations, flossing once a day is a necessary step in your oral health care regimen. That\u2019s just two additional minutes out of your day, all to ensure your smile stays healthy.</p>\n<h2>Here at</h2>\n<h3>Exquisite Dentistry</h3>\n<p>, we consider ourselves a team\u2014with a common goal. So, here are a few painless recommendations to help you work flossing into your daily routine.</p>\n<h2>Create a Visual Reminder</h2>\n<p>Visual cues remind you about your goals. Put a sticky note on your mirror with \u201cFLOSS\u201d spelled out in bold. Keep your floss right in front of your toothbrush. Set a reminder on your phone. Do anything that will trigger your memory and get you flossing.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>Build on Top of Another Habit</h2>\n<p>Building a tiny habit like flossing is completely doable. It\u2019s even easier if you associate it with another habit. Try flossing before you brush your teeth in the morning. Perhaps you could floss right when you get out of the shower. If you watch SportsCenter every night, why not floss right when it starts? This is called habit \u201cchunking,\u201d an unpleasant name with pleasant consequences.</p>\n<h3>Make It Fun</h3>\n<p>Flossing can be fun? Just look to Chonpe, a monkey in Japan who loves to floss. It is possible! Use the two minutes spent flossing to practice your mindfulness... or blissfully zone out. Listen to a good podcast or cue up a funny YouTube video. If all else fails, why not mix things up with some flossing gadgets? Flosstime, a sleek new floss dispenser, sticks right to your mirror and lights up with a blue smile when you floss once a day. Be warned\u2014it turns into a frown if you skip a day! Commit to 30 Days There are conflicting reports on how many days it takes to develop a new habit. Some say 21, while others say there\u2019s no magical timeline. Our recommendation is that you commit to flossing every day for 30 days. You can even mark each day with an \u201cX\u201d on your calendar to keep yourself motivated. At day 31, we\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll be reaching for the floss without even having to think about it. Now the next time your dentist asks you if you floss, we hope you can truthfully say \u201cYes!\u201d No more white lies\u2014just white teeth and healthy gums. Your smile will thank you for it. Of course, flossing is only a small part of your oral healthcare routine. Don\u2019t forget to keep up with your regular dental appointments, including teeth cleaning and annual oral cancer screening. Exquisite Dentistry is here to help! Contact us today and set up your appointment at West Hollywood\u2019s premiere dental spa.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>For patients looking for a beautiful, radiant smile, dental veneer restoration may be the answer. Veneers are translucent, yet durable pieces of porcelain that are bonded to the front of teeth to enhance their color and shape, as well as fix damage. They can also close gaps between teeth. Veneers are a relatively simple solution to transforming a smile in 3 visits to your cosmetic dentist. High-quality porcelain veneers often last many years, and can last 20 years with proper care. Then, it\u2019s time for a cosmetic dentist to help restore them. Veneer restoration typically involves three visits to the dentist. During the first visit, your cosmetic dentist will make a mold of your teeth. On your second visit, temporary veneers will be applied to your teeth, allowing you to \u201ctest drive\u201d your selection. At the final visit, you\u2019ll have the temporary veneers removed and the permanent veneers bonded into place. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be on your way with a brand new, stunning smile! Proper veneer maintenance is the best way to get the most out of your new smile. By making proper veneer maintenance a priority, you can get additional years out of their lifespan.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>At Exquisite Dentistry of Los Angeles,</h2>\n<h3>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h3>\n<p>works hard to make sure that patients get the highest-quality veneers possible. Once you leave the office after your final veneer restoration appointment, there are several steps you need to take to ensure you\u2019ll get the most out of your new smile. Consider these five tips to help you maintain your new veneers.</p>\n<h2>Key Points</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Brush and Floss</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This may seem like common sense, but it\u2019s vitally important to regularly brush and floss. By cleaning away the plaque, you can avoid tartar buildup that hinders the look of your veneers. Cleaning food particles out of your teeth and gums will help prevent dental caries, as well as an infection. When you\u2019re brushing and flossing, don\u2019t forget to: Brush two by two. This means you need to brush for two minutes in the morning and two minutes in the evening. Don\u2019t cut the time short; set a timer to ensure you don\u2019t shortchange your brushing time. Use a proper toothbrush. Just as a carpenter needs to have the proper tools when they work, you need the right tool for maintaining your veneer restoration. A soft to medium bristle is best for the job. Additionally, make sure you change your brush every three months or sooner if the bristles are worn. Floss once a day. Many people neglect to floss, which is a detriment to their veneers and their overall oral health. For ease of use, many people prefer to use pre-strung floss picks.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Use Your Teeth the Right Way</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We\u2019ve all used our teeth for something we shouldn\u2019t have at one time or another. Whether it\u2019s tearing open a package, chewing ice, or as an impromptu tool, we\u2019ve all made the mistake before. Misuse of your teeth can be harmful to your oral health. For those with veneer restoration, it can be even more damaging. Proper veneer upkeep requires that you don\u2019t use your teeth as tools for anything besides eating. Although veneers are firmly bonded to your teeth, they\u2019re not impervious to misuse. Take care of your veneers, and they\u2019ll take care of you!</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Avoid Grinding Your Teeth</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Porcelain veneers are extremely durable. They\u2019re almost as resilient as your natural enamel. Those who deal with bruxism (teeth grinding) should understand that even these hard surfaces can be worn down over time due to constant teeth grinding. If you deal with teeth grinding, have an honest conversation with your dentist before receiving veneer restoration treatment. They can offer a solution like a dental mouth guard, which can keep the teeth from grinding. Your dentist can also offer other alternate solutions, such as stress management or biofeedback to help deal with the problem at its root cause.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Use a Mouthguard for Sports</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do you enjoy playing in a local rec league? How about your company\u2019s softball team? No matter your sport of choice, everyone should make sure they utilize a well-fitting mouthpiece. However, this is even more important if you have had veneer restoration. Speak to your dentist about having a custom-fitted mouthguard created for you to aid in proper veneer upkeep.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Visit the Dentist Regularly</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It would be a shame to have a beautiful veneer restoration and then neglect to see the dentist for your semi-annual teeth cleaning and exam. Unfortunately, patients routinely miss their twice-a-year visit to the dentist. By doing so, they limit the overall lifespan of their veneers. Before you leave the office from your final veneer appointment, make sure you schedule your next six-month checkup. If you wait until later to call, you\u2019ll likely forget. Many patients are shocked that it\u2019s been two or three years since their last exam, simply because time got away from them. Your veneers deserve better, so keep on a regular examination schedule.</p>\n<h2>Veneer Restoration From Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>If you live in the Los Angeles area, schedule a visit with Dr. Aguil\u2019s team at Exquisite Dentistry.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>You can say a lot with a smile. That simple gesture shows that you\u2019re happy, approachable, and relatable. A smile is an invitation to connect with someone personally and professionally. Everyone deserves to feel confident in their smile as a child and as an adult. At Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles, Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team have helped hundreds of adults to improve their smile through cosmetic dentistry. When it comes to straightening teeth for adults, his two most effective methods are Invisalign treatment and porcelain veneers.</p>\n<h2>The Best Methods for Teeth Straightening</h2>\n<p>For many, crooked teeth are the biggest obstacle preventing adults from having an A-list smile. Traditional braces are the first thing we think about when it comes to adult teeth straightening. Our second thought typically goes to former classmates in our younger years who had their braces for years. If braces for adult teeth are keeping you from perfecting your smile, there are better ways to do it. A cosmetic dentist like Dr. Alexie Aguil can work with you to find an option like Invisalign that works for you and your lifestyle.</p>\n<h2>Top Teeth Straightening Treatments</h2>\n<h3>Invisalign Clear Aligners</h3>\n<p>Traditional and lingual braces work. But there is one method that works faster and more comfortably, and you can even take them out to eat and take photos. For most, the best method for straightening your teeth is Invisalign. Invisalign has been rapidly gaining popularity and earning praise over the last 20 years. Dr. Alexie Aguil, one of the leading providers of Invisalign in the United States, praises its teeth straightening technology and superiority over traditional braces for adult teeth. Invisalign is efficient at correcting your smile without self-consciousness slowing you down. Life doesn\u2019t have to change just because you\u2019re straightening your teeth. Every day, your dream smile gets closer to reality, and the people around you may not even notice. You\u2019ll visit your dentist only often enough to be fitted for new aligners, each one straighter than the last as they work their magic.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h3>How Invisalign Works</h3>\n<p>At Exquisite Dentistry, your journey towards straighter teeth starts on day one. With our advanced scanning technology, you\u2019ll be able to see what your teeth will look like after treatment is complete. You\u2019ll be sent a set of clear aligners every week. This teeth-straightening process continues until the desired results are achieved, sometimes in as little as 6 months. Treatment can be flexible to keep your mouth comfortable. Some Invisalign patients report slight discomfort when wearing their new aligners, but generally, Invisalign is a painless process. Your teeth can even be shifted one at a time in order to alleviate some discomfort. Exquisite Dentistry is also one of the few practices that offers Fast Track\u2122 Aligner Accelerator. Patients can be proud of their smiles in less time, all thanks to a specialized dental practice they can trust. It\u2019s easy to see why so many celebrities and professionals are turning to Invisalign for straighter teeth instead of braces.</p>\n<h3>Porcelain Veneers</h3>\n<p>Dental veneers are a great fix for damaged, misaligned, or discolored teeth, as well as teeth with unwanted gaps. With only 3 appointments required, veneers are one of the quickest ways of straightening adult teeth. At Exquisite Dentistry, patients can achieve their perfect smile in just three simple visits as opposed to months of teeth-straightening visits for traditional braces. Veneers are made from thin porcelain and placed over existing teeth for natural-looking results. Digital scans are taken of the teeth in need of correction, giving patients a chance to work with Dr. Aguil to help design their ideal smile. A small section of the tooth is buffed down and replaced by a temporary until the permanent porcelain veneers arrive. Patients with veneers can eat with and brush their teeth just like they normally would. For adults wanting straighter teeth, there\u2019s no other method this easy, or with better results.</p>\n<h2>Traditional Braces Aren\u2019t for Everyone</h2>\n<p>Besides being indiscreet, traditional braces are often uncomfortable and inconvenient. While lingual braces are harder to spot, the lisp they cause is often more prominent. For professionals in need of a jaw-dropping smile without the obvious signs, traditional braces for adults are not the way to go. The frequent maintenance needed for both types of braces often leaves patients frustrated. They\u2019ll also need to take extra steps when brushing and flossing. By Contrast, clear aligners and porcelain veneers are easy to care for. Your clear aligners can be cleaned or even removed before bed. And veneers can be brushed and flossed like any other tooth.</p>\n<h2>It\u2019s Time to Embrace Your Smile</h2>\n<p>Adults wanting straighter teeth don\u2019t have to hide their smile. If clear aligners or veneers are right for your lifestyle, Exquisite Dentistry can give you the healthy, camera-ready smile you\u2019ve been waiting for. Located in Los Angeles, Exquisite Dentistry specializes in adult oral health. For patients, the result is an unrivaled and comfortable experience that makes going to the dentist less stressful. We all need to take care of ourselves, our teeth especially. How we feel about our smile is an aspect of overall wellness that cosmetic dentistry can improve. When you\u2019re a patient at Exquisite Dentistry, Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team work actively to ensure your experience is as comfortable as possible. With noise-canceling headphones and Netflix recommendations at hand, patients can relax as their lives change forever. Start your journey today.</p>\n<h2>Call Exquisite Dentistry at</h2>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 and schedule your first appointment, or contact us over our website to schedule your consultation now.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>A brilliant smile is priceless. Here in Los Angeles, celebrities and business leaders are famous for the smiles their careers are built on. If you want a world-class smile, this city is the place to make it happen. Celebrities worldwide achieve this with porcelain veneers, a dental treatment for shaping, aligning, and coloring their teeth with a completely natural appearance. So what is the cost of dental veneers in Los Angeles, and what makes them worth it?</p>\n<h2>Price of the Highest-Quality Dental Veneers</h2>\n<h3>Typical Cost:</h3>\n<p>About $20,000 for a 10-unit veneer design.</p>\n<h2>Cost for All Teeth:</h2>\n<p>About $50,000 for a 32-unit veneer design Cost per Tooth: $1800 to $2500 The cost can be dependant on the number of teeth treated. The price may also vary due to diagnostic costs and the delivery method that is used. Why The Best Dental Veneers are Well-Worth the Price A Natural Look Top-quality porcelain veneers are virtually indistinguishable from natural teeth.</p>\n<h2>World-Class Comfort</h2>\n<p>Exquisite Dentistry in West Hollywood is the original dental spa. Even enjoy music or Netflix.</p>\n<h3>An Exceptional Dentist</h3>\n<p>Dr. Aguil will work with you every step of the way to design your ideal smile with an expert touch.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Technology</h3>\n<p>On your very first visit, our iTero scanner shows you what your teeth will look like after treatment is complete.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>Stay Away from Budget Veneers</h2>\n<p>Top-quality porcelain veneers at Exquisite Dentistry are made at one of the best dental labs in the United States and fitted by a leading cosmetic dentist. But not every set of veneers is made with the same quality and care. You could go with one of these other options to cut down on the cost of veneers for your teeth, but it\u2019s not recommended. Discount veneers cut all sorts of corners. They\u2019re often made in China, and not well-customized to fit your mouth. Expect to see that fake plastic look; the color gives them away every time. And forget reliability. High-end porcelain veneers are expected to last a decade or longer, but you\u2019ll need to replace cheap veneers much sooner than you expect. Save yourself the trouble, the pain, and the potential embarrassment of low-cost veneers on your teeth. Get your cosmetic dentistry done right.</p>\n<h2>How Dental Insurance Factors Into the Cost</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies try to only pay for what they have to. Veneers may have a fantastic impact on your life and career, but they\u2019re mostly seen as elective procedures in the eyes of insurance companies. It\u2019s unlikely that the cost of dental veneers will be covered by your insurance. If medically indicated, the partial cost of veneers for some of your teeth may be covered as crown repair or crown replacement. Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry will work with you to make the most of your insurance.</p>\n<h2>Consult on Your Treatment with Dental Veneers</h2>\n<p>Dr. Aguil and his team will help you achieve the smile you\u2019ve always wanted with attentive, personalized care. Treatment with dental veneers can often be completed in as few as 3 visits. Expect the most comfortable experience you\u2019ve ever had at the dentist.</p>\n<h3>Call</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 to schedule your appointment with Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles.</p>\n      </div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for an easy way to make extraordinary improvements to your smile, veneers are the perfect option. Dental veneers are thin, translucent coverings that are placed over the front of a tooth, instantly transforming a problematic tooth into a perfect one. Veneers are a wonderful fit for several types of cosmetic dentistry uses, including: Tooth discoloration:</p>\n<h2>Although</h2>\n<p>teeth whitening is often a popular choice to achieve a whiter, brighter smile, veneers can accomplish the same job. Veneers are a good option when there are other issues to address along with tooth discoloration, allowing you to address multiple problems at the same time. Additionally, on the rare occasions there are tooth-coloring issues that cannot be solved through traditional whitening measures, veneers are also an appropriate choice. Cracked or chipped teeth: Although enamel is the hardest surface in the human body, it\u2019s not impervious to cracking. If a tooth has cracked through eating, a blow to the mouth, or from some other trauma, a veneer may be helpful in these situations. Worn teeth: Those that grind their teeth will wear them down over time. When this occurs, veneers can restore the shape and function of the teeth. Gaps between teeth: If teeth are misshapen, or if they have small gaps between them, veneers are an option to restore function and beauty to the smile. How do you know if veneers are the best choice for your situation? When you visit your dentist, they will assess the issues that are hindering your smile from reaching its fullest potential and give you options for restoring the look and function of your teeth. If you deal with some of the conditions listed above, you\u2019re likely a good candidate for dental veneers. Whether you need to transform a few teeth or all 32, high-quality veneers can be a game-changer. What Materials are Veneers Made Of? If you\u2019re considering veneers, there\u2019s an important choice you\u2019ll need to make before you get too far in the process: you\u2019ll need to select veneers made from either porcelain or composite resin. The type of material used for your veneers will in large part determine the overall outcome of your treatment. There are pros and cons to each option. Yet, at Exquisite Dentistry, we have a belief that one material is far superior to the other. Dr. Alexie Aguil has worked with patients who have experienced both types of veneers, and the feedback he\u2019s received over the years has made it clear which option patients prefer.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>Veneer Material: Medical-Grade Porcelain</h2>\n<p>Many dentists prefer to use FDA-approved dental porcelain to fashion their veneers. Although some would point to their higher initial price, there are numerous advantages to porcelain veneers. Pros of Porcelain veneers: Offer a more natural look than composite resin Compare to the hardness of enamel, allowing them to be extremely resistant to chipping Last about ten years, but often last much longer with good oral care and regular dental checkups Can aid in fixing more serious cosmetic blemishes Extremely resistant to staining, meaning veneers will retain their color over time. A lower-cost option over the longer term, since they are more durable than less expensive materials used to create inexpensive veneers Cons of Composite veneers Come at a higher short-term investment Although porcelain veneer material represents a more significant initial investment than composite veneers, in the long run, you\u2019ll have a better overall experience.</p>\n<h2>Veneer Material: Composite Resin</h2>\n<p>Resin is a tooth-colored material that is shaped over the exterior of the tooth and then bonded in place. You\u2019ll find that composite resin veneers are often found at a relatively low cost, and there are a couple of reasons for this: Compared to medical-grade porcelain, composite resin is less expensive material and process to use. Composite veneers can be placed over teeth in only one visit to the dentist, compared to three visits with porcelain. There are both positive and negative qualities of resin as the material for your veneers. Pros of Composite veneers Result in lower overall costs for the patient (in the short-term) More easily fixed or replaced if damaged Cons of Composite veneers Can discolor over time Not resistant to wear and tear like porcelain veneers Often lack a natural appearance, leading to a fake or plastic smile Choose Exquisite Dentistry for Porcelain Veneers Because of the all-encompassing look, feel, and outcome from porcelain veneers, Dr. Alexie Aguil only offers this veneer option at Exquisite Dentistry. If you\u2019re looking for an exquisite smile, you\u2019ll need to use the finest veneer materials. Over and over, Dr. Aguil\u2019s patients have thanked him for helping them choose natural looking porcelain veneers.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Dental veneers are an outstanding investment in your smile. They last many years with exceptional care. Just like natural teeth, they will show signs of wear over time. Then it\u2019s time to consult a cosmetic dentist on veneer replacement.</p>\n<h2>Extending the Life of Your Veneers</h2>\n<p>Because they are a cosmetic procedure that health insurance companies don\u2019t generally cover, dental veneers are usually a sizable investment for the patients who get them. So individuals who choose veneers should understand the following: Veneers are not permanent, even those made with the highest-quality materials Veneers can be broken, damaged, or stained, just like regular teeth Patients that are vigilant about brushing, flossing and seeing their dentist for regular checkups and cleanings have the best results People who stay vigilant about their oral care will prolong the life-span of their veneers. That could mean a few extra years before they need veneer replacement. Being dedicated to maintaining your veneers, your smile, and your oral health only takes a little extra effort.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>Ways to Extend the Life of Your Veneers</h2>\n<p>Avoid using tobacco products and eating or drinking things that can stain teeth (pasta sauce, wine, coffee, dark soda, etc.) Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and ask your dentist about a non-abrasive toothpaste that you can start using every day Start wearing a mouthguard when playing sports (for protection) and wear a night guard when you sleep Can you be perfect for the life of your veneers? That\u2019s a tall order. You\u2019ll likely get a soda at lunch here and there or jump into a game of basketball without your mouthguard at some point. However, keeping the investment value of your veneers in mind is usually enough motivation to keep them in the best shape possible. The day will eventually come when your veneers need replacement. And at that point, you\u2019ll need to talk to your dentist about the veneer replacement process.</p>\n<h2>Replacing Veneers: What to Expect</h2>\n<p>Getting a new set of veneers fitted is very much like getting your first veneers. Your dentist will remove the old veneers and buff the outer layer of the tooth. With the old veneers removed, your dentist will take a new mold of your teeth and order the new veneers based on that mold to match your other teeth as closely as possible. This is the perfect time to change the design or shade of your smile if you want. Once the veneers have been created and shipped back to the dentist, they will attach the veneers to the teeth, just like the original procedure to get the veneers positioned for the perfect smile.</p>\n<h3>Call Exquisite Dentistry</h3>\n<p>When it comes to veneers, you\u2019ll be able to call Exquisite Dentistry and have Dr. Alexie Aguil guide you through the entire experience.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Dental veneers have become a popular way for people in Los Angeles to significantly improve their smile. Veneers are thin structures of porcelain that can be bonded to your teeth to give them a naturally-bright white look, as well as to improve their shape and spacing. If you\u2019re looking for a bright Hollywood smile, you need to visit Dr. Alexie Aguil and his team at Exquisite Dentistry. He has the experience and skills you\u2019re looking for when considering dental veneers. He\u2019s worked with hundreds of patients, and their beautifully restored smiles speak for themselves!</p>\n<h2>Choosing</h2>\n<h3>Veneer Shapes</h3>\n<h2>: The Background of Veneers</h2>\n<p>So, what are dental veneers? They\u2019re thin, yet durable pieces of FDA-approved, medical-grade materials bonded directly to the teeth. Veneers are able to cover a host of different issues that cause smiles to lose their radiance: Cosmetic issues: Veneers have become a go-to cosmetic dentistry treatment because of how easily they are able to cover minor cosmetic issues. Although some people choose our Zoom! Advanced Teeth Whitening system, we\u2019ve found that many of our patients love how veneers easily bring the shine back to their smile. Structural issues: Not only can veneers help make teeth whiter and brighter, but they can also help solve a multitude of structural issues. Teeth that are chipped, cracked, or that have gaps between them can see remarkable results with porcelain veneers. How do you know if veneers are the best option for your teeth? Schedule a consultation with Exquisite Dentistry, and Dr. Aguil will work with you to choose the best options for your treatment.</p>\n<h2>Choosing Veneer Shapes: Your Treatment Plan</h2>\n<p>Most patients are surprised at how simple the process of receiving dental veneers can be. How simple? In as little as three visits, your smile will be transformed: Visit #1: During your initial consultation, Dr. Aguil will make a digital impression of your bite using our advanced technology. From the 3D images created, he\u2019ll be able to easily show you the best treatment options for your unique situation. In between the first and second visits, Dr. Aguil will begin to work with one of the best dental laboratories on the West Coast. Using his expertise and guidance, they\u2019ll work together to begin crafting your veneers. Visit #2: To begin, Dr. Aguil will buff off a small layer of each tooth, giving the veneer a secure surface for bonding. Then, he\u2019ll carefully affix a temporary veneer to your tooth, which will last until your next appointment. During this time, you\u2019ll evaluate the veneer shape and color. Once you\u2019ve settled on the perfect veneer style and fit, your permanent veneers will be readied. Visit #3: Your temporary veneers will be removed and your permanent veneers will be bonded to your teeth. You\u2019re all set, and your veneers will last many years with proper care. As you can see, the process couldn\u2019t be any simpler. However, you may wonder at what point in the process you will choose the shape and style of your veneer.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>Choosing Veneer Shapes: Finding the Perfect Fit</h2>\n<p>During your first appointment, you\u2019ll select both the shape and color of your veneers. As you begin the process, it\u2019s important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. You want to select a style that makes you happy. Perhaps the most important part of the process for choosing your veneers deals with their shape. You\u2019ll find that there are many different veneer shapes, which may be considered part of a few different categories.</p>\n<h2>Dental Veneer Shape Types:</h2>\n<h3>Aggressive:</h3>\n<p>A generally square-shaped style.</p>\n<h3>Dominant:</h3>\n<p>Similar to Aggressive, yet with differing incisors.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced:</h3>\n<p>A more rounded look, which is often a sought-after style for models.</p>\n<h3>Functional:</h3>\n<p>Similar to Enhanced. With Functional style, you\u2019ll find the canines are more pointed, making them more functional for eating.</p>\n<h3>Hollywood:</h3>\n<p>The name says it all! One of the most highly-prized styles as these veneers give the classic smile so prized in movies and television.</p>\n<h3>Mature:</h3>\n<p>An offshoot of Aggressive, but with more pointed canine teeth.</p>\n<h3>Natural:</h3>\n<h3>A</h3>\n<p>veneer style that is similar to Enhanced, but with much more sharply-shaped canines.</p>\n<h3>Oval</h3>\n<p>: All of the canine and incisors take on a more rounded look.</p>\n<h3>Softened:</h3>\n<p>An even more rounded look than Oval.</p>\n<h3>Vigorous:</h3>\n<p>Aggressive-styled teeth with canines that protrude further than average.</p>\n<h3>Youthful:</h3>\n<p>This style is a blend of the Vigorous and Oval styles. Dr. Aguil is a leader in his field, he will be able to show you several of these styles and guide you to decide the best shape for your veneers. Using his advanced software, he can even give you a glimpse of what you would look like with each style of veneer. In the end, you\u2019ll be able to choose your veneer style in total confidence.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Are you looking to enhance your smile and boost your confidence? Dental veneers offer the best solution that can transform the appearance of your teeth, addressing issues such as discoloration, chipping, misalignment, and irregularities in shape. As a top cosmetic dentist in Los Angeles, Dr. Alexie Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry understands the importance of making informed decisions about your dental investments. In this article, Dr. Aguil answers some common questions and provides insights into whether veneers are a good investment for you. What are dental veneers and what do they help with? Dental veneers are thin, custom-made shells made of porcelain or composite resin that are bonded to the front surface of teeth, often in addition to dental crowns. They help improve the appearance of teeth by addressing issues such as discoloration, chipping, misalignment, or irregularities in shape. At Exquisite Dentistry, we use the highest-quality materials to ensure that our veneers are of the utmost quality. Through a meticulous process involving digital impressions, professional ceramists, and careful adjustments, we craft the most refined, natural-looking veneers for each of our patients. The LA market, in general, wants a super white, Hollywood smile, so Dr. Aguil uses his \u201cspecial powers\u201d to finesse the most natural-looking shade of dazzling white. How soon do veneers work? Veneers can give you a whole new set of teeth nearly immediately. The results of veneers are fast and dramatic, with our patients having their final veneers in as little as 3 to 6 weeks. Our veneer process at Exquisite Dentistry typically involves several visits. During the evaluation and modeling visit, we capture digital impressions and work with a professional ceramist to design a model of your porcelain veneers. Dr. Aguil and his ceramist have custom-crafted veneers together for many years. In the veneer preparation visit, the temporary restorations are set until the final veneers are complete. Patients are then provided a two-week trial period to assess their veneers\u2019 look, feel, and function. The third visit involves finalizing and bonding the custom porcelain veneers, ensuring the shape and color are exactly right for you. How long do veneers last? With proper care and maintenance, veneers can last 10 to 15 years or even longer. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene, such as brushing, flossing, and keeping a hygiene appointment every 4-6 months, are essential for their longevity. It is also important to treat veneers with care, avoiding habits like biting on hard objects or using teeth as tools, which can potentially damage them. With proper care, you maximize the longevity and value of your investment. Are veneers a good option for everyone? Veneers are suitable for many, many people and in many cases. However, a comprehensive dental evaluation is necessary to determine their suitability for your specific needs. Factors such as tooth and gum health, bite alignment, and overall oral condition should be assessed to ensure that veneers are a viable option for you. Can veneers fix all types of dental imperfections? Veneers are highly versatile and can address a wide range of cosmetic issues, but not all dental imperfections. Veneers are effective in concealing dental imperfections such as chipped, oddly shaped, crooked, or discolored teeth. However, severe misalignment or extensive tooth damage may require alternative treatments like orthodontics or dental crowns. A highly-trained and experienced cosmetic dentist can determine the most appropriate solution for your unique situation. How much do veneers cost? The cost of veneers varies based on factors such as material and the number of teeth being treated. While high-quality veneers and crowns require an upfront investment of around $2,000-2,500 per tooth, their long-lasting aesthetic benefits often make them a worthwhile investment. It is important to discuss the cost and payment options with your insurance provider and dentist. Are veneers worth the cost? Investing in dental veneers can provide you with a fast and dramatic change, resulting in the beautiful and confident smile of your dreams. While the cost of custom-made veneers may require a considerable investment, the long-term benefits and the boost in confidence, they provide make them valuable for your oral health and overall well-being. Whether you\u2019re an actor, a model, or a professional who is constantly seen in meetings and presentations \u2014 an investment in your smile is an investment in your earnings potential.</p>\n<h2>Exquisite Results</h2>\n<p>At Exquisite Dentistry, our veneers are crafted from the highest quality porcelain, yielding the thinnest possible surface and minimizing the reduction in natural tooth structure. Dr. Aguil\u2019s expertise as a cosmetic dentist and veneer expert ensures that veneers are tailored to each patient\u2013and each tooth\u2013yielding the most natural-looking and beautiful results.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Invisalign</h2>\n<p>has revolutionized orthodontic treatment with its stunning results and discreet and convenient approach. As the leading teeth straightening system, Invisalign can deliver a gorgeous smile for adults and teens seeking either small aesthetic changes or major structural improvements. At Exquisite Dentistry, under the expert guidance of Dr. Aguil, a GoldPlus Invisalign provider, Invisalign is at the pinnacle of teeth-aligning technology. In this article, Dr. Aguil addresses some common questions regarding Invisalign as an investment and sheds light on its numerous benefits. What is Invisalign and how does it work? Invisalign is a modern orthodontic treatment that utilizes clear aligners to gradually shift teeth into their desired position. The aligners are custom-made and virtually invisible, making them a highly attractive alternative to traditional braces, especially for adults. The treatment process involves a series of aligners, each used for approximately 1 to 2 weeks, providing an easy and comfortable teeth straightening experience. Is Invisalign worth the investment compared to other aligners and braces? Absolutely. While there are other aligner brands on the market, Invisalign has been leading the way for 30 years and is unmatched in experience and effectiveness. Invisalign also offers a host of advantages over traditional braces, including its virtually undetectable appearance and removability, allowing for easier oral hygiene maintenance. With Invisalign, patients experience greater comfort, convenience, and confidence throughout the treatment process. How long does the Invisalign treatment typically take? The duration of Invisalign treatment varies depending on individual cases, but technological advancements, that only invisalign can provide, as well as starting early and before problems worsen, have led to shorter treatment times. At Exquisite Dentistry we generally quote a range of 6 to 12 months, though it is quite common to achieve faster results due to Invisalign\u2019s advanced techniques and technology. Exquisite Dentistry patients also have the option for accelerators, which can produce results in as little as 3 months. Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations to Invisalign? Invisalign is highly effective for most orthodontia. That said, it is essential for patients to wear the aligners consistently and take proper care of them to achieve successful results in the shortest time. Complex orthodontic issues may require alternative treatments; a top-rated Invisalign dentist can advise you on whether Invisalign is ideal for your particular case. What is the cost of Invisalign treatment? The cost of Invisalign can vary depending on the complexity of the case. Many dental insurance plans provide coverage for Invisalign treatment under standard orthodontic benefits (see more about that below). In addition, at Exquisite Dentistry, we understand that cost can be a concern for some patients; therefore we offer flexible payment options and no-fee financing plans to make Invisalign\u2013and a beautiful healthy smile\u2013more accessible. Does insurance cover Invisalign? In many cases, Invisalign treatment is covered by standard orthodontic insurance benefits. Dental insurance plans that provide coverage for traditional braces often extend the same coverage to Invisalign. However, it\u2019s important to review the specifics of your insurance policy to determine the extent of coverage. At Exquisite Dentistry, we work closely with our patients to maximize their insurance benefits and offer guidance on navigating the insurance process. Our team is dedicated to helping you achieve your desired smile while making payment as easy as possible. What is the cost of doing nothing \u2013 can it lead to expensive dental problems down the road? Misaligned teeth can exert pressures that degrade tooth, gum, and bone health over time. The resulting issues, such as cracks, infections, and root problems, often necessitate costly dental work like root canals and crowns. By investing in Invisalign, you are proactively preventing these dental problems and maintaining the overall health of your teeth. A $5,000 investment in Invisalign is a relatively small price to pay compared to the cost of extensive dental work later in life. Additionally, straighter teeth are easier to keep clean, reducing the risk of gum disease and contributing to a healthier mouth and body. What makes Invisalign worth it? Invisalign and a gorgeously aligned smile provide an opportunity to improve your oral health, enhance your appearance, and unlock your career-earning potential. With Invisalign, you can embrace the modern way of straightening your teeth, while enjoying the benefits of a comfortable, discreet, and effective treatment.</p>\n<h3>The Exquisite Difference</h3>\n<p>Invisalign is undoubtedly a sound investment for those seeking a beautiful, confident smile and improved oral health. With its advanced technology, shorter treatment times, and the expertise of Dr. Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry, you can achieve the smile you\u2019ve always desired. Schedule a consultation with us today and discover why Exquisite Dentistry is consistently ranked as the #1 Invisalign provider in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Choosing Veneers or Implants for Your Teeth</h2>\n<p>When it comes to veneers or implants, both options offer a life-changing transformative solution that can significantly enhance your smile, confidence, and overall dental health. Porcelain veneers are thin, durable shells of high-quality porcelain placed over the teeth to effectively mask imperfections such as chips, stains, or gaps. They offer a fast and minimally invasive solution to enhancing the appearance of your smile and provide immediate results with minimal discomfort. Occasionally, veneers are used in conjunction with dental implants to replace missing or badly damaged teeth. Implants are titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone to replace missing teeth. This option offers a permanent solution that looks, feels, and functions just like natural teeth. Implants restore your smile\u2019s appearance, help preserve jawbone integrity, and prevent dental issues associated with tooth loss. When deciding between veneers or implants, factors such as the condition of your teeth, your oral health, and your desired outcome should be considered. At Exquisite Dentistry in LA, cosmetic dentist Dr. Alexie Aguil is highly skilled in porcelain veneers and dental implants, the optimal use of each, and how to effectively use them together. With years of experience and a dedication to providing exceptional care, Dr. Aguil will answer all your questions and guide you through a treatment plan that is ideal for your case and personal goals. What are Dental Veneers? Porcelain veneers can address various issues that often prevent people from feeling confident about their smiles. Veneers offer a long-lasting solution, effectively correcting cracks, chips, and tooth coloration. Moreover, veneers can straighten crooked teeth and fill gaps between teeth for a fully comprehensive transformation. With their natural appearance and durable quality, porcelain veneers enhance the aesthetics of your smile, boost your self-esteem, and allow you to smile confidently. Partnering with one of the finest dental laboratories in the US, Dr. Aguil crafts each veneer out of the highest quality porcelain to create a natural smile. The treatment process typically takes place over several visits:</p>\n<h3>Initial Consultation:</h3>\n<p>Dr. Aguil starts with a complete exam and cleaning. Then, using our advanced iTero 3D Scanner, he takes a comprehensive digital map of your mouth. Together, you discuss options, including the shape and color of your veneers. Our technology will show you what your smile will look like before you start! Similar to a haircut, it can be helpful to bring in a photo of your ideal smile to guide the discussion with a visual reference. Dr. Aguil will work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that aligns with your aesthetic goals.</p>\n<h3>Follow-Up Visit:</h3>\n<p>Before your final veneers are created, Dr. Aguil will place temporary veneers over your teeth, carefully shaping individual teeth to create the best surface to help each veneer hold securely. He\u2019ll then place the temporary veneers on top of the teeth. These temporary veneers are a model of the final veneers. You\u2019ll notice the transformation immediately, but Dr. Aguil wants you to love them 100% and for the long term, which is why he insists on a try-in period. During the try-in period, you will communicate with him about what you like best about the temporary veneers and what you\u2019d like to change\u2014from color and shape to comfort and your speaking ability.</p>\n<h3>Final Visit:</h3>\n<p>During this visit, your temporary veneers are removed, and the custom-made veneers are securely bonded in place. With your new veneers in place, you\u2019re all set to enjoy years of beautiful smiles. Just like that, your smile is transformed. This seamless process is why many patients choose veneers to enhance their smiles and confidence. What are Implants? Dental implants are artificial roots made of titanium that replace the structure of the missing tooth. Dr. Aguil may recommend dental implants to replace teeth and fix issues related to tooth loss or damage. It\u2019s important to note that all dentists can place implants, but since Dr. Aguil does not, he makes sure to partner with highly skilled specialists near our West Hollywood office to perform the procedure.\u00a0Depending on the case, Dr. Aguil may suggest a different treatment, like a dental bridge, which anchors to the teeth on either side. Dental implants offer a stronger and more permanent solution for tooth loss. Though the results are equally beautiful for veneers and implants, the implant process is quite different and can take a few months to complete:</p>\n<h3>Initial Consultation:</h3>\n<p>Should Dr. Aguil determine that implants are the right course of treatment for you, he will refer you to our long-time specialists, who will perform their own examination.</p>\n<h3>Preparation:</h3>\n<p>The specialists will prepare your mouth by gently cutting back your gums and inserting a custom-made artificial tooth root into your jawbone. After a few months, your gums will completely heal, allowing for osseointegration, where the jawbone fuses to the implant. Similar to the veneer process, Dr. Aguil works closely with the dental laboratory to guide the implant crown creation. The added layer of quality control ensures that the crown fits the shape, color, and size of your natural teeth.</p>\n<h3>Implant Placement:</h3>\n<p>Once your titanium root is in place and healed, you\u2019ll prepare for your final implant restoration. Dr. Aguil will gently remove the healing cap and make the proper measurements to ensure that your replacement fits exactly as it should. Then, your newly crafted crown will be affixed to the implant. When the process is complete, your smile will be happy and healthy once again. While anesthetic is unnecessary, the treatment itself is done with your absolute comfort in mind. Local anesthetic or gentle sedation options are available at your request. Your jaw may be sore for as long as a few months following your implant, which is easily managed with over-the-counter medication.</p>\n<h2>How Veneers and Implants Work Together to Create Your Perfect Smile</h2>\n<p>While veneers are a popular choice for enhancing the appearance of existing teeth, they are not suitable in cases where a tooth is missing. In such instances, dental implants emerge as a viable alternative, offering a durable and aesthetically pleasing solution for tooth replacement. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that the integration of an implant into the jawbone requires a healing period that can span several months, making it a more time-intensive option compared to other treatments like bridges, which can quickly address gaps left by missing teeth. During consultations, patients often inquire about implants, though these discussions typically revolve around concerns such as replacing missing teeth, rectifying issues with damaged teeth, or updating old crowns, rather than as part of a veneer application. This distinction underscores the importance of tailoring treatment recommendations to the specific needs and circumstances of each patient, ensuring that all options are considered in the context of achieving a harmonious and functional veneer smile makeover. If you\u2019re missing a tooth or need to restore dental function, your primary options typically involve a dental implant or a dental bridge. Each option serves a distinct purpose, and Dr. Aguil can determine the most appropriate treatment based on your specific needs and goals.</p>\n<h2>Exquisite Dentistry: Los Angeles\u2019 Choice for Veneers and Implants</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re considering veneers or implants, Exquisite Dentistry is the premier destination in LA for all your dental needs.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Should you choose dental veneers or braces to shape your teeth and align your bite? This is ultimately a discussion to have between you and your dentist, but it always helps to prepare yourself with information. If you live in the area of Los Angeles, California, then Dr. Alexie Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry can help you determine the best treatment for a radiant smile. And even if not, we\u2019d be happy to share our insights to help you learn more and decide together with a dentist near you. What are Dental Veneers? Dental veneers are a thin material that a dentist can adhere to teeth for restoring damage, adjusting their shape, and improving their overall look. The highest quality porcelain veneers applied by a skilled cosmetic dentist will look and feel natural. What are Dental Braces? Dental braces are devices that gently push and reposition teeth over time. Traditional metallic braces are kept in the mouth and readjusted (tightened) until the right alignment is reached. Invisalign treatment is a popular alternative to metallic braces. Invisalign uses a series of clear aligners that can be removed when you eat, or for other activities. But even when you take photos, you probably won\u2019t even see them. That\u2019s the beauty of Invisalign.</p>\n<h2>A Complete Change to Bite Registration</h2>\n<p>Both of these treatments may completely change the alignment of your teeth and the shape of your bite. This makes them both effective at treating misaligned teeth and closing gaps between teeth. But there are a few benefits to one or the other depending on the results you\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Dental Veneers vs. Braces</h2>\n<p>In addition to aligning your teeth, porcelain veneers are an excellent treatment for enhancing their overall appearance. When treatment is done through a top cosmetic dentist, such as here at Exquisite Dentistry in Los Angeles, the advanced ceramic materials will give you the look and feel of natural teeth. Additionally, dental veneers can be used to adjust the actual shape of the teeth themselves, not just their alignment or position in your mouth. The process for dental veneers typically takes 3-4 trips to the dentist. You can see the desired results much more quickly than with braces in as little as a couple weeks.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Dental Braces vs. Veneers</h2>\n<p>Dental braces or Invisalign treatments are best used for substantial alignment or spacing issues. Patients have teeth that don\u2019t line up properly at all and can even be experiencing discomfort in their mouth or jaw. This misalignment of teeth (called malocclusion) can lead to wear and tear on your teeth, gums and even bone that isn\u2019t normal and can lead to worse issues down the line. The Invisalign system incorporates a series of high definition 3D aligners, each custom-made for the patient, that shift teeth to the desired position with each step forward throughout the series. Before you even have to wear your first aligner, you\u2019ll get to view your final smile using our advanced iTero scanner right in Dr. Aguil\u2019s office. It only takes a few minutes to scan your mouth, then create a 3D movie of what the end results will look like.</p>\n<h2>With You From Start to Finish</h2>\n<p>The best way to determine what to choose between veneers vs. braces is to schedule an appointment with Exquisite Dentistry. In your first consultation, we\u2019ll analyze your smile and bite, and then find the best steps to get them where you want them to be. A consultation with Dr. Aguil is the first step to getting the smile you\u2019ve always wanted. He will look at the health of your teeth and determine the best course of treatment based on your individual desires. With your final goal in mind, he will break down the best way to achieve it\u2014be it with porcelain veneers or Invisalign braces. Invisalign can be used to align your smile, but veneers may also be added after treatment for certain issues that braces cannot resolve, such as discoloration of the natural teeth. Dr. Aguil can use veneers to reshape and therefore change your bite into the natural position that Invislign would. However, using veneers, he can also create the best elements of a Hollywood smile. The discussion of \u201cveneers vs. braces\u201d can instead become \u201cveneers OR braces\u201d or even \u201cveneers AND braces,\u201d depending on your needs.</p>\n<h2>Feel Comfortable in Our Care</h2>\n<p>Exquisite Dentistry in West Los Angeles is the premier place to maintain a healthy mouth and bring out your best smile.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Everyone wants a beautiful Hollywood smile. There are plenty of at-home remedies, but they\u2019re often ineffective toothpastes, messy trays, or sloppy bleach gels that just don\u2019t give the best results. If you want your teeth to lighten by several shades, teeth whitening at the dentist\u2019s office is your best choice. A skilled dentist can help you quickly and safely brighten your smile. There are several ways that a dentist may whiten your teeth, and your dentist will work with you to tailor your treatment to get the results you\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<h2>How a Dentist Can Whiten Your Teeth</h2>\n<h2>Here at Exquisite Dentistry of Los Angeles,</h2>\n<h3>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h3>\n<p>has been transforming smiles for years. If you visit his dentist\u2019s office for teeth whitening, he\u2019ll typically recommend one of three treatment options. Zoom! Advanced Teeth Whitening Zoom! Whitening is advanced laser teeth whitening that delivers the quickest and most noticeable results of any whitening method. The best teeth-whitening dentists choose Zoom as their preferred treatment method. Here\u2019s how it works. First, your teeth will be thoroughly cleaned to remove tartar buildup and maximize the teeth whitening effects. A whitening gel will be applied to your teeth. Then, your dentist will shine the Zoom! Light on your teeth to remove stains and discoloration. The entire process takes about 60 minutes and safely brightens even the most sensitive of teeth. Zoom! Advanced teeth whitening treatment is how a dentist can whiten your teeth by up to 8 shades in a single visit!</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury.</p>\n<h3>Porcelain Veneers</h3>\n<p>In situations where patients are looking to make more significant cosmetic changes to their smile, Dr. Aguil may recommend porcelain veneers. These thin, translucent porcelain pieces create the natural look of bright white teeth while helping to repair damage, and giving them the ideal shape. Porcelain veneers typically require three visits to the dentist for teeth whitening: Visit one: Dr. Aguil will consult with you about your goals for your smile. If you\u2019d like to move forward with veneers, he\u2019ll make a digital impression of your teeth. He\u2019ll send these measurements to one of the most prestigious dental ceramists on the West Coast. Together, they\u2019ll begin to hand craft your veneers. Visit two: Temporary veneers are placed over your treated teeth. These short-term coverings will help determine the ideal fit and feel you\u2019re looking for. Changes to the final veneers can be made during this \u201ctry-in\u201d period to assure that your smile design will be the smile that works best for you. Visit three: The temporary veneers are removed and the finished porcelain veneers are securely bonded to your teeth. Veneers will often last ten years or more with proper care. During your next dentist visit, Dr. Aguil can consult with you about whether you\u2019re a good candidate for high-quality porcelain veneers, as well as use advanced technology to show you what your smile will look like when treatment is complete.</p>\n<h2>General Teeth Cleaning &amp; Care</h2>\n<p>When was the last time you had your semi-annual cleaning? Before recommending other treatments, Your teeth will be cleaned with state-of-the-art methods and technology. Many patients find that this cleaning will help gently remove light stains on their teeth, especially if they haven\u2019t kept up twice-yearly dentist visits. At your cleaning, a dental hygienist will gently sweep away plaque and tartar that have built up on your teeth over time. In just a few minutes, you\u2019ll achieve a brighter, healthier smile! Even if you\u2019ve already decided on laser whitening, regular cleaning and care are how a dentist can whiten your teeth and keep them that way.</p>\n<h2>Dentist Teeth Whitening At Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>If you live in the greater Los Angeles area, you\u2019ll want to visit Exquisite Dentistry for your teeth whitening.

  "content": "<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n        <h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>You want your smile to dazzle\u2014in person and in photos. So when your pearly whites begin to lose their shine, you need a whitening solution that\u2019s convenient, safe, and effective. With multiple popular teeth-whitening options on the market, you want to make sure you choose the best solution for your long-term beauty and wellness. Before choosing a treatment, it is important to discuss whitening options with your dentist\u2014especially if you\u2019ve had dental work done. Whitening only affects your actual teeth, so your smile may lose its natural look if you have crowns, bridges, or fillings. Your dentist will also be able to predict how your teeth will react to treatment, based on your age, the strength of your enamel, and other factors.</p>\n<h2>Over-the-Counter Solutions</h2>\n<p>Those looking for easy ways to whiten your teeth may immediately think about teeth-whitening kits you can find at the store. Whitening strips and trays bought at drugstores and other retailers may make your teeth look whiter in as little as two weeks, but they only reduce surface stains\u2014often with inconsistent, short-lived results.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. Since over-the-counter whiteners are considered cosmetic products, they are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Common complaints and side effects include gum irritation and a temporary increase in tooth sensitivity. If you already have sensitive teeth or if you\u2019ve had plenty of dental work in the past, OTC products may not be the best solution for you. In short, while kits may be an easy teeth whitening method, it\u2019s also the least effective and most risky.</p>\n<h2>Dentist-Supervised, At-Home Bleaching</h2>\n<p>While most whitening strips only cover portions of your smile, custom-made bleaching trays can whiten all of your teeth. Your dentist can fit you with a tray\u2014which reduces the risk of bleach contacting your gums, in turn lowering your risk of gum irritation. This method is supervised by your dentist, so they can monitor how your teeth and gums react to treatment, and adjust the concentration of bleach accordingly. You may notice results in about two weeks if you perform the technique daily. In-office Teeth Whitening If you\u2019re looking for an easy way to whiten your teeth, the first two options are time-consuming and messy. The easiest teeth whitening method is to have your teeth whitened at your dentist\u2019s office.</p>\n<h3>Dr. Alexie Aguil</h3>\n<p>at Exquisite Dentistry utilizes the Zoom Advanced teeth whitening system to produce the fastest, longest-lasting results. In less than 90 minutes, you can achieve a younger, healthier, more confident smile\u2014all without messy trays or uncomfortable side effects. Exquisite Dentistry performs Zoom Advanced teeth whitening treatment\u2014making sure every patient is comfortable and relaxed. For lasting radiance, we find this solution gives you a consistent, polished look, and brightens your smile for the long haul. Want to learn more about our laser teeth whitening treatment?

Accidents happen. Maybe it was a bad fall. Perhaps sports got a little too competitive. Or maybe you bit down hard candy or other food, and now you\u2019re regretting it. Chipping a tooth can be stressful, especially before your wedding, graduation, interview, or big audition. If you don\u2019t know what to do after chipped tooth, your initial reaction may be to panic, but rest assured that your smile and confidence can be restored.</p>\n<h2>Dr. Alexie Aguil at Exquisite Dentistry</h2>\n<p>is West Hollywood\u2019s leader in restorative and cosmetic dental services. He knows what to do to fix your chipped tooth. His precision and skill will give you the best possible outcome for the situation.</p>\n<h3>Dr. Aguil</h3>\n<p>answers questions about chipped teeth on a regular basis. He\u2019s listed some of the most common questions he hears at his Los Angeles office and his answers to these important queries. \u201cI Chipped My Tooth. How Bad Is It?\u201d The first question Dr. Aguil usually fields from concerned patients is about the extent of the damage to the tooth. Because tooth damage occurs for a variety of reasons, there are several types of injuries to look out for. Craze lines are minor surface cracks that develop on the enamel of your tooth, which may not require treatment. This is the best-case scenario in dealing with a cracked or chipped tooth. Broken cusps involve damage to the chewing surface of your teeth. Though not painful, these injuries may require reshaping and crowns. Minor chips are usually not too painful but may need to be repaired with polishing and/or filling.</p>\n<h3>A</h3>\n<p>cracked tooth consists of damage to your whole tooth\u2014from the enamel to the root. If left untreated, the crack can worsen over time and become a split tooth. The crack may also be harboring bacteria that can lead to cavities\u2014potentially infecting the root and leading to more extensive treatments, such as root canal therapy and a dental crown.</p>\n<h3>Cavities</h3>\n<p>can weaken your teeth, resulting in decay-induced breaks. Following the recommendation of your dentist and hygienist, we can detect cavities before extensive treatments are needed. This is the best way to avoid cavities is to ensure you are keeping your semi-annual dental cleaning appointments.</p>\n<h2>Restore Your Smile\u2019s Brilliance</h2>\n<p>With your smile the best it\u2019s ever looked, your confidence will be at an all-time high</p>\n<h3>CONTACT EXQUISITE DENTISTRY</h3>\n<p>(323) 272-2388 Call to schedule your cosmetic dentist appointment and experience true luxury. \u201cI Chipped My Tooth. How Do I Care For It?\u201d If you\u2019ve damaged one or more of your teeth, schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as you can. If it\u2019s a dental emergency, they may be able to fit you in sooner. In the meantime, follow these simple instructions if you\u2019re still not sure what to do with your chipped tooth: Clean out your mouth with lukewarm water. Water that is too hot or too cold could cause significant pain to any exposed nerves in the pulp of the cracked tooth. If you notice bleeding as a result of a damaged tooth, apply pressure to the injured area using clean gauze. Maintain gentle pressure until the bleeding has subsided. Protect the affected tooth until your upcoming dentist appointment. Dental cement is an effective temporary solution and can be found at most drugstores or big-box retailers like Target or Walmart. Orajel can topically dull the pain of a chipped or cracked tooth, but you should use any type of medication with caution. Check with your dentist before using any over-the-counter dental products. If the damage causes pain that a topical medication cannot alleviate, take an over-the-counter pain reliever like Tylenol or Advil. Be sure to follow instructions carefully to take the proper dosage. Eat only soft foods and avoid using the chipped tooth to chew. \u201cI Chipped My Tooth. What Will the Dentist Do?\u201d Your treatment will depend on the severity of your injury. For a minor chip, the dentist may polish the affected tooth to make its surface smoother and less likely to cut the inside of your mouth. For extensive damage\u2014when your tooth\u2019s nerve is exposed, for example\u2014the dentist may recommend a root canal and a crown to replace the broken tooth. The only way a dentist will know what to do with a chipped tooth is by viewing the tooth and possibly taking X-rays of the affected area. For many chipped teeth, your dentist will use a veneer or crown to restore your smile\u2019s natural beauty\u2014and to protect inner layers from further damage, including infection. Following treatment, it is important to maintain a consistent routine of brushing and flossing, and regular visits to your dentist. \u201cI Chipped My Tooth? Where Should I Go?\u201d Because chipped and cracked teeth can vary so widely, you need to make sure that you choose a dentist that knows what to do with any type of chipped tooth. Your oral care is too important to trust to just any dentist. You need a dentist who has the best technology, skill set, and team in place to handle your situation.
