    question: "Do you offer Invisalign for Beverly Hills patients?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many patients travel from Beverly Hills to our Wilshire Blvd Los Angeles studio for Invisalign planning and check-ins. We coordinate schedules so visits are efficient and progress stays predictable."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Invisalign take?",
    answer:
      "Many adults finish cosmetic alignment in about 6–12 months, while bite-focused or complex cases can take longer. After your scan and exam, we’ll outline a realistic timeline and the milestones you can expect."
  },
  {
    question: "How often are Invisalign appointments?",
    answer:
      "Most patients check in about every 6–10 weeks, depending on the plan and how teeth are tracking. We’ll confirm the ideal cadence and help you schedule around travel and events."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need attachments for Invisalign?",
    answer:
      "Many plans include small tooth-colored attachments to help aligners grip and move teeth more precisely. We’ll explain where they go, how noticeable they are, and how they support your specific movements."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Invisalign hurt?",
    answer:
      "You can expect temporary pressure when switching to a new set of aligners, especially in the first few days. Most patients describe it as mild soreness rather than pain, and it usually settles as you adapt."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I drink coffee or wine with aligners in?",
    answer:
      "It’s best to remove aligners for anything other than cool water. Hot or colored drinks can stain trays and may increase cavity risk if sugar is trapped against teeth. If you do drink something besides water, rinse and brush before putting aligners back in."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have crowns, veneers, or bonding?",
    answer:
      "You may still be a candidate. Existing dental work can affect how attachments are placed and how we plan finishing. We’ll evaluate your restorations and recommend a sequence that keeps your final result consistent and natural-looking."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after Invisalign treatment?",
    answer:
      "Retention is essential. You’ll wear retainers to maintain alignment, and we’ll give you a plan that fits your lifestyle (often full-time at first, then nightly). We can also coordinate whitening or small cosmetic refinements after alignment if desired."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Invisalign cost in Beverly Hills?",
    answer:
      "Pricing varies based on case complexity, how many aligners are needed, and whether refinements or retainers are included. After your consultation and scan, we provide a clear, itemized estimate and discuss payment options."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you plan Invisalign around a wedding or important event?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you have a deadline, we’ll map a schedule that prioritizes what can be accomplished before the date and what should be staged afterward. We can also coordinate finishing touches like whitening when timing makes sense."
