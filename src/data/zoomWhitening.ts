    question: 'How long does Zoom teeth whitening take?',
    answer:
      'Most in-office Zoom whitening appointments take about 60–90 minutes. We start with a quick exam and shade check, then protect your gums, apply the whitening gel in timed cycles, and finish with aftercare guidance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does Zoom whitening cost in Los Angeles?',
    answer:
      'Pricing depends on your starting shade, sensitivity history, and whether we include take-home touch-up gel for maintenance. After an exam, we’ll confirm candidacy and give you a clear, all-in estimate before starting.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Zoom whitening safe?',
    answer:
      'Yes—Zoom whitening is widely used and safe on healthy natural teeth when supervised by a dental professional. We evaluate enamel, gum health, and restorations first to make sure whitening is appropriate for your smile.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my teeth be sensitive after treatment?',
    answer:
      'Some people feel temporary sensitivity for 24–48 hours. We use a comfort-first protocol and can recommend desensitizing products to keep you comfortable before and after whitening.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do results last?',
    answer:
      'Results commonly last several months to a couple of years, depending on diet, coffee/tea/wine habits, and home care. Touch-ups and regular cleanings help maintain a brighter shade longer.'
  },
  {
    question: "Can I whiten if I have veneers, crowns, or fillings?",
    answer:
      'Whitening gel only lightens natural tooth enamel. Veneers, crowns, and fillings won’t change color, so we’ll plan around any visible restorations to keep your final shade looking consistent.'
