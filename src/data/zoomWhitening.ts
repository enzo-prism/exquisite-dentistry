    question: 'How long does Zoom teeth whitening take?',
    answer:
      'Most in-office Zoom whitening appointments take about 60–90 minutes. We start with a quick exam and shade check, then protect your gums, apply the whitening gel in timed cycles, and finish with aftercare guidance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does Zoom whitening cost in Los Angeles?',
    answer:
      'Pricing depends on your starting shade, sensitivity history, and whether we include take-home touch-up gel for maintenance. In-office Zoom whitening typically starts around $595, and we’ll confirm candidacy and provide a clear estimate before starting.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How many shades whiter can Zoom whitening make my teeth?',
    answer:
      'Many patients brighten about 3–8 shades depending on starting shade, enamel, and stain type. We’ll do a shade assessment before and after treatment so you can see the change clearly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Zoom whitening safe?',
    answer:
      'Yes—Zoom whitening is widely used and safe on healthy natural teeth when supervised by a dental professional. We evaluate enamel, gum health, and restorations first to make sure whitening is appropriate for your smile.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my teeth be sensitive after treatment?',
    answer:
      'Some people feel temporary sensitivity for 24–48 hours. We use a comfort-first protocol and can recommend desensitizing products to keep you comfortable before and after whitening.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I avoid after Zoom whitening?',
    answer:
      'For the first 24–48 hours, we recommend avoiding dark foods and drinks that can stain (coffee, tea, red wine, berries, dark sauces). We’ll also review aftercare steps to help reduce sensitivity and keep your new shade stable.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do results last?',
    answer:
      'Results commonly last several months to a couple of years, depending on diet, coffee/tea/wine habits, and home care. Touch-ups and regular cleanings help maintain a brighter shade longer.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I get a cleaning before Zoom whitening?',
    answer:
      'Often, yes. A professional cleaning can remove surface buildup so whitening is more even. If you’re due for a hygiene visit, we can coordinate your cleaning and whitening timeline for smoother results.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How soon before an event should I do Zoom whitening?',
    answer:
      'If you’re whitening for photos, a wedding, or an important event, many patients schedule about 7–10 days ahead so the shade settles naturally and any temporary sensitivity has time to calm.'
  },
  {
    question: "Can I whiten if I have veneers, crowns, or fillings?",
    answer:
      'Whitening gel only lightens natural tooth enamel. Veneers, crowns, and fillings won’t change color, so we’ll plan around any visible restorations to keep your final shade looking consistent.'
