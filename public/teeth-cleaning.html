  <h1>Teeth Cleaning in Los Angeles</h1>
  <p>Keep your smile bright with spa-level preventive visits that combine advanced technology, oral cancer screenings, and comforting amenities.</p>
  <p>Professional cleanings at Exquisite Dentistry go far beyond a polish. We pair meticulous hygiene with a relaxing, concierge-style visit so you look forward to every appointment.</p>
<p>Your hygienist personalizes the experience around sensitivity levels, gum health, and lifestyle habits, while Dr. Aguil checks in to map out a proactive plan.</p>
  <ul><li>Spa-Level Comforts: Noise-canceling headphones, aromatherapy, cozy blankets, and a calm environment keep anxiety low and relaxation high.</li>
<li>Early Detection: Digital X-rays, intraoral cameras, and VELscope® scans let us uncover concerns before they become emergencies.</li>
<li>Personalized Maintenance: We tailor recall frequency, fluoride options, and at-home products to your enamel, gum health, and cosmetic goals.</li></ul>
  <h2>Benefits</h2>
  <ul><li>Gentle, Thorough Cleaning: We remove plaque and tartar while protecting enamel with high-quality instruments and enamel-strengthening polishes.</li>
<li>Whole-Health Monitoring: Regular periodontal charting and screenings keep an eye on inflammation markers that affect total wellness.</li>
<li>Cosmetic Longevity: Protect veneer edges, whitening results, and Invisalign progress with targeted polishing protocols.</li></ul>
  <h2>Treatment Timeline</h2>
  <ol><li>01. Comfort Menu &amp; Exam — Choose your amenities, review medical history, and begin with a comprehensive exam and oral cancer screening.</li>
<li>02. Precision Cleaning — Your hygienist removes buildup above and below the gum line, finishing with an enamel-specific polish.</li>
<li>03. Personalized Plan — Leave with tailored recommendations for at-home care, fluoride, whitening boosts, and your next visit cadence.</li></ol>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p><strong>How often should I schedule a professional cleaning?</strong><br/>Most patients benefit from two cleanings per year. If you have a history of gum inflammation, cosmetic investments, or medical considerations, we may recommend more frequent visits to protect your smile.</p>
<p><strong>Can I whiten and clean in the same visit?</strong><br/>Yes. A professional cleaning is the ideal prep for whitening because it removes buildup that could block the gels. Let us know when booking so we can reserve time for both.</p>
<p><strong>Do you screen for oral cancer?</strong><br/>Every hygiene visit includes a visual exam plus VELscope® imaging to catch abnormalities early. It’s painless, fast, and included in your appointment.</p>
