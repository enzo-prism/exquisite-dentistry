# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds all TypeScript source. Keep shared UI in `components/` (shadcn), routed views in `pages/`, logic in `hooks/`, and supporting data under `utils/`, `constants/`, and `data/`. Prefer the `@/...` alias defined in `tsconfig.json`.
- `public/` serves static assets verbatim. Add favicons, OG images, and CMS exports here only.
- `scripts/` stores project chores such as `optimize-images.js`; update assets or maintenance tasks in this folder.
- `dist/` is generated by Vite builds—never edit or commit manual changes.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` sets up dependencies.
- `npm run dev` starts Vite on `localhost:5173` with hot reload.
- `npm run build` compiles the site; `npm run build:prod` optimizes images before the production build and is what Netlify runs.
- `npm run preview` serves the compiled bundle locally for smoke testing.
- `npm run lint` executes ESLint with the repo’s flat config; resolve or document every warning.
- `node test-browser.js` launches the Puppeteer smoke test. Start the dev server first and review console output for regressions.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TS and TSX files use 2-space indentation, ES modules, and React function components. Name components with PascalCase, hooks with a `use` prefix, and utilities in camelCase.
- Keep Tailwind classes in JSX `className` strings; compose variants with helpers in `@/lib`.
- Let ESLint enforce style and accessibility checks. Run it before committing and use `npm run lint -- --fix` for safe autofixes.

## Testing Guidelines
- Treat linting and build outputs as required gates before opening a pull request.
- For UI or routing changes, run `node test-browser.js` and capture its console output to document manual verification.
- If you introduce automated tests, place them under `src/__tests__/` (Jest-compatible structure) so future tooling can discover them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow the existing commit style: short, imperative subjects with optional prefixes such as `Fix:`, `Update`, or `Refactor`. Keep the first line under ~72 characters and expand context in the body if needed.
- Each PR should include: a concise summary of the change, linked issues or Linear tickets, screenshots or screen captures for visual changes, and a checklist of commands/tests executed (`build`, `lint`, smoke tests).
- Mention any configuration updates (e.g., Netlify redirects) explicitly so deployment reviewers can double-check `netlify.toml` or other infra files.
